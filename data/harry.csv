36516,"Albus Severus,"" Harry said quietly, so that nobody but Ginny could hear, and she was tactful enough to pretend to be waving to Rose, who was now on the train, ""you were named for two headmasters of Hogwarts."
36396,"Mrs. Weasley cried as a few students ran forward, trying to come to her aid."
36390,"Seamus Finnigan and Hannah Abbott, darted past him into the Great Hall, where they joined the fight already flourishing inside it.And now there were more, even more people storming up the front steps, and Harry saw Charlie Weasley overtaking Horace Slughorn, who was still wearing his emerald pajamas."
36341,"Hagrid's unexpected bellow nearly forced Harry's eyes open."
36309,"Harry did not dare open his eyes, but allowed his other senses to explore his predicament."
36244,"It is a curious thing, Harry, but perhaps those who are best suited to power are those who have never sought it."
36093,"Convinced as he was of his total solitude, this did not concern him, but it did intrigue him slightly."
36084,"Hagrid was struggling, and Bellatrix was panting, and Harry thought inexplicably of Ginny, and her blazing look, and the feel of her lips on his ¨C Voldemort had raised his wand."
36079,"He knew that the snake was too well protected, knew that if he managed to point the wand at Nagini, fifty curses would hit him first."
36061,"Some of them were still masked and hooded; others showed their faces."
36026,"It did not matter about bringing them back, for he was about to join them."
35955,"That would have been why Dumbledore wanted him to confide in two others... so that if he fulfilled his true destiny a little early, they could carry on..."
35914,"Then he ripped in two the photograph he was also holding, so that he kept the part from which Lily laughed, throwing the portion showing James and Harry back onto the floor, under the chest of drawers..."
35794,"I ¨C I come with a warning ¨C no, a request ¨C please ¨C ""Dumbledore flicked his wand."
35786,"But you call everyone of my birth Mudblood, Severus."
35770,"But Mulciber's and Avery's idea of humor is just evil."
35729,"Lily gave herself away by half-glancing toward where Snape stood nearby."
35725,"It's good you're being separated from normal people."
35702,"He picked up a fistful of leaves and began tearing them apart, apparently unaware of what he was doing."
35601,"Harry lifted the silvery substance into it with his wand."
35575,"The stab of rage felt like a spike driven through Harry's head: he forced his own fist into his mouth to stop himself from crying out in pain."
35536,"It jabbed at a place near the roots, and at once, the writhing tree became still."
35524,"Shapes moved out in the darkness, swirling figures of concentrated blackness, moving in a great wave towards the castles, their faces hooded and their breath rattling..."
35517,"He thought he could make out an enormous arm waving from the midst of the spider swarm, but as he made to chase after them, his way was impeded by a monumental foot, which swung down out of the darkness and made the ground on which he stood shudder."
35501,"The stairs beneath their feet flattened into a chute and she, Harry, and Ron hurtled down it, unable to control their speed but so fast that the Death Eaters' Stunning Spells flew far over their heads."
35469,"Pushing Hermione ahead of him with Ron, Harry stooped to seize Fred's body under the armpit."
35457,"I don't think I've heard you joke since you were ¨C ""The air exploded."
35442,"Then, through the smoke, Harry saw a rectangular patch on the wall and steered the broom at it, and moments later clean air filled his lungs and they collided with the wall in the corridor beyond.Malfoy fell off the broom and lay facedown, gasping, coughing, and retching."
35347,"What hiding place had Tom Riddle discovered inside Hogwarts Castle, that he believed would remain secret forever?"
35339,"So, Voldemort had managed to wheedle the location of the lost diadem out of the Gray Lady."
35303,"He leapt up from the plinth and tore back the way he had come, now in pursuit of his one last hope."
35159,"We'll say Alecto was ambushed by the kids, them kids up there"" ¨C he looked up at the starry ceiling toward the dormitories ¨C "" and we'll say they forced her to pres her Mark, and that's why he got a false alarm...."
35148,"The Ravenclaws were whispering amongst themselves, terrified."
35142,"He had chosen to make sure of the locker before coming...but that would not take him long...."
35140,"Harry closed his eyes, and as his scar throbbed he chose to sink again into Voldemort's mind...."
35131,"Which makes you pretty skint, witless,"" said a cackling voice.Harry whirled around, slipped off the plinth, and landed on the floor."
35075,"Harry looked from Ron to Hermione, who murmured, ""I think Ron's right."
35046,"He looked at Ron and Hermione, trying to tell them without words that Voldemort had just discovered the loss of one of the other Horcruxes."
35013,"But we were still fighting, doing underground stuff, right up until a couple of weeks ago."
34943,"You can't move her, she's in no fit state, you can't take her with you, wherever it is you're planning to go, when you're making your clever speeches, trying to whip yourselves up a following."
34868,"Harry drew the curtains then pulled the Cloak off himself and Ron."
34853,"They ran behind the counter and through a second doorway, which led to a trickery wooden staircase, that they climbed as fast as they could."
34852,"Harry was sure of it: They seemed to be coming more quickly now, taking those dragging, rattling breaths he detested, tasting despair in the air, closing in - He raised his wand: He could not, would not suffer the Dementor's Kiss, whatever happened afterward."
34832,"We'll go to Hogsmeade,"" said Harry, ""and try to work something out once we see what the protection around the school's like."
34818,"Nevertheless, it would be prudent to alert Snape to the fact that the boy might try to reenter the castle...."
34797,"He, the greatest wizard of them all; he, the most powerful; he, the killer of Dumbledore and of how many other worthless, nameless men."
34791,"The Elder Wand slashed through the air and green light erupted through the room; the kneeling goblin rolled over dead; the watching wizards scattered before him, terrified."
34709,"He was trying to listen: He thought he could hear something clanking and moving around nearby."
34685,"Oh yes, I see,"" said Travers, looking down at Bellatrix's wand, ""yes, very handsome. and is it working well?"
34660,"I heard that your own was¨C""""I have my wand here,"" said Hermione coldly, holding up Bellatrix's wand."
34653,"It's Travers,"" hissed the goblin into Harry's ear, but at that moment Harry could not think who Travers was."
34601,"Harry reached instinctively for the hilt of the sword and drew it close to him, but regretted his action at once."
34557,"Fleur came running out of the kitchen, looking frightened; Bill jumped to his feed, his wand pointing at the door; Harry, Ron, and Hermione did the same."
34516,"Back in the smallest bedroom, Harry made the offer, careful to phrase it so as not to give any definite time for the handover of the sword."
34512,"Harry met her eyes with a mixture of defiance and shame."
34429,"Harry caught glimpses of Bill, Fleur, Luna, and Dean sitting at the table in the kitchen, cups of tea in front of them."
34411,"Harry was suddenly reminded of how unsure, when they first met, of how much he liked Ollivander."
34354,"He probably told her it was a treasured possession and asked her to place it in her vault."
34315,"He wanted to get through this interview with Griphook quickly, and at the same time was afraid of making a false move."
34275,"He looked out over the ocean and felt closer, this dawn, than ever before, closer to the heart of it all.And still his scar prickled, and he knew that Voldemort was getting there too."
34272,"Dobby would never be able to tell them who had sent him to the cellar, but Harry knew what he had seen."
34241,"And as everybody looked at her, she addressed the dead elf at the bottom of the grave."
34221,"Horcruxes...yet no longer burned with that weird, obsessive longing."
34215,"Grief, it seemed, drove Voldemort out...though Dumbledore, of course, would have said that it was love.On Harry dug, deeper and deeper into the hard, cold earth, subsuming his grief in sweat, denying the pain in his scar."
34186,"At the last word there was a peculiar grinding noise from above."
34147,"Of course, Harry Potter,"" whispered the little elf."
34139,"He seized the little goblin by the arm and backed out again, dragging Griphook with him."
34109,"They were forced down a steep flight of stairs, still tied back-to-back and in danger of slipping and breaking their necks at any moment."
34058,"Closing his puffy eyes, he allowed the pain in his scar to overcome him for a moment, wanting to know what Voldemort was doing, whether he knew yet that Harry was caught...."
33950,"I'd say that it's one short step from 'Wizards first' to 'Purebloods first,' and then to 'Death Eaters,'"" replied Kingsley."
33871,"Harry watched the cloudy sky, curves of smoke-gray and silver sliding over the face of the white moon."
33867,"If he had known about the Deathly Hallows, he might not have needed Horcruxes in the first place."
33815,"Her fingers sketched quotation marks around the name, and her tone dripped sarcasm."
33806,"The Deathly Hallows...such rubbish...although actually,"" a sudden thought seemed to have struck her, ""he might have made it all up, mightn't he?"
33700,"Just keep your head down, mind your own business, and you'll be okay."
33656,"That very night, another wizard crept upon the oldest brother as he lay, wine-sodden upon his bed."
33625,"He suppose he ought to be glad of it; anyone he came into contact with was in danger, Xenophilius's attitude proved that. he turned away from the windows and his gaze fell upon another peculiar object standing upon the cluttered, curved slide board; a stone but of a beautiful but austere-looking witch wearing a most bizarre-looking headdress."
33602,"You'd better come up."" said Xenophilius, still looking extremely uncomfortable, and he led the way.The room above seemed to be a combination of living room and workplace, and as such, was even more cluttered than the kitchen."
33560,"Catchopole from the breezy hillside to which they Disapparated next morning."
33548,"He looked into her intense, eager face and then out into the surrounding darkness, thinking."
33480,"So I Disapparated and came out on the side of a hill."
33464,"Gosh, what a gripping story,"" Hermione said in the lofty voice she adopted when wishing to wound."
33397,"Now was not the time for long discussions; now was the moment to destroy once and for all."
33309,"His impulse to shout for Hermione, which had been so strong a moment ago, had gone."
33303,"The light seemed simply to drift toward him.He jumped to his feet, his voice frozen in his throat, and raised Hermione's wand."
33261,"I know Bathilda thought it was all just talk, but 'For the Greater Good' became Grindelwald's slogan, his justification for all the atrocities he committed later."
33219,"We must stress this point, it will be the foundation stone upon which we build."
33206,"At the time of Kendra's death, Bathilda was the only person in Godric's Hollow who was on speaking terms with Dumbledore's mother.Unfortunately, the brilliance that Bathilda exhibited earlier in her life has now dimmed."
33187,"He riffled through the pages, looking for photographs."
33033,"He wondered when was the last time anyone had been inside Bathilda's house to check whether she was coping."
33018,"Was it not likely that it was she who had moved in the shadows in the graveyard and had followed them to this spot?"
32968,"He put his arm around Hermione's shoulders, and she put hers around his waist, and they turned in silence and walked away through the snow, past Dumbledore's mother and sister, back toward the dark church and the out-of-sight kissing gate."
32946,"But it seemed that to Dumbledore, the fact that their families lay side by side in the same graveyard had been an unimportant coincidence, irrelevant, perhaps, to the job he wanted Harry to do.Hermione was looking at Harry, and he was glad that his face was hidden in shadow."
32916,"He stowed the Cloak under his jacket and they made their way forward unhampered, the icy air stinging their faces as they passed more cottages."
32902,"It was in Godric's Hollow that, but for Voldemort, he would have grown up and spent every school holiday."
32838,"Despite his previous assertion that he would never visit them again, Phineas Nigellus did not seem able to resist the chance to find out more about what Harry was up to and consented to reappear, blindfolded, every few days of so."
32829,"There were moments when he did not know whether he was angrier with Ron or with Dumbledore."
32654,"It was his first real home, the place that meant he was special: it meant everything to him, and even after he left ¨C """"This is You-Know-Who we're talking about, right?"
32640,"The argument about the dementors was forgotten in laughter that night, and Harry felt cheerful, even hopeful, as he took the first of the three night watches.This was their first encounter with the fact that a full stomach meant good spirits, an empty one, bickering and gloom."
32449,"The chains clinked and withdrew into the arms of the chair."
32431,"She cried harder than ever.Umbridge laughed a soft girlish laugh that made Harry want to attack her."
32380,"It was very strange to have Mr. Weasley glare at him with that much dislike."
32225,"In the meantime, they returned to the basement kitchen, where Kreacher served them all stew and treacle tart.They did not get to bed until late that night, after spending hours going over and over their plan until they could recite it, word perfect, to each other."
32222,"They glared at each other; Harry knew that he had not convinced Hermione and that she was marshaling counterarguments, against both his theory on his wand and the fact that he was permitting himself to see into Voldemort's mind."
32173,"Dad always told us most Ministry people use the Floo Network to get to work,"" Ron said."
32139,"The lurkers were never the same two days running, although they all seemed to share a dislike for normal clothing."
32113,"His immediate thought was that Lupin had burst back into the room, and for a split second, he did not take in the mass of struggling limbs that had appeared out of thin air right beside his chair."
31993,"Halfway down the flight of stairs into the hall, however, he heard a tap on the front door, then metallic clicks and the grinding of the chain.Every nerve in his body seemed to tauten: He pulled out his wand, moved into the shadows beside the decapitated elf heads, and waited."
31927,"He saw what had happened as clearly as though he had been present.""..."
31893,"It was the only chance, the only slender hope left to them, and he was going to cling to it until forced to let go."
31871,"A little puff of dust rose from the bedcovers as she sat down to read the clippings."
31868,"The Black family crest was painstakingly painted over the bed, along with its motto, TOUJOURS PUR."
31867,"The Slytherin colors of emerald and silver were everywhere, draping the bed, the walls, and the windows."
31865,"Regulus's bedroom was slightly smaller than Sirius's, though it had the same sense of former grandeur."
31763,"The one facing him bore a nameplate reading Sirius."
31689,"Tall, dilapidated houses looked down on them from every side."
31669,"He looked down at the paralyzed Dolohov, thinking fast as the lock clicked and Ron used the Deluminator to plunge the caf¨¦ into darkness."
31645,"Let's sit down somewhere,"" Hermione said hastily as Ron opened his mouth to shout back across the road."
31624,"Harry and Hermione jumped to their feet and drew their wands."
31609,"Never once, in six years, had Dumbledore told Harry that they had both lived and lost loved ones in Godric's Hollow."
31590,"Albus was heartbroken-""""His heart wasn't the only thing."
31575,"You would say that, Elphias,"" cackled Auntie Muriel."
31530,"The strange triangular eye was gleaming on his chest."
31528,"His pugnacious tone indicated that they were not about to laugh at Xenophilius, despite the clear provocation."
31522,"We'll have time later,"" shrugged Ron, snatching three butterbeers from a passing tray and handing one to Harry."
31480,"As she drifted off after her father, Ron reappeared with an elderly witch clutching his arm."
31442,"All the old kids' stories are supposed to be Beedle's aren't they?"
31396,"Not quite,"" said Scrimgeour, who looked bad tempered now."
31382,"I'm asking the questions,"" said Scrimgeour, shifting his chair a little closer to the sofa."
31333,"I require a private word with you,"" Scrimgeour went on."
31187,"His parents' graves were only part of the attraction: He had a strong, though inexplicable, feeling that the place held answers for him."
31177,"Spattergroit's really contagious, so they're not going to want to go near him."
31161,"I ¨C Hermione, I'm sorry ¨C I didn't ¨C """"Didn't realize that Ron and I know perfectly well what might happen if we come with you?"
31101,"Dumbledore didn't want anyone else to know, Mrs. Weasley."
31034,"He chased Mad-Eye first, and when Mundungus gave them away he switched to Kingsley...."
31029,"They didn't know there would be seven Harrys, that confused them the moment we appeared, and in case you've forgotten, it was Mundungus who suggested that little bit of skullduggery."
30999,"Always the tone of surprise,"" he said a little grumpily, breaking free."
30956,"Expelliarmus saved me from Voldemort two years ago,"" Harry added defiantly."
30949,"None of the Order would have told Voldemort we were moving tonight,"" said Harry."
30924,"The Portkey,"" he said, remembering all of a sudden."
30867,"There was a deafening bang and the sidecar broke away from the bike completely."
30783,"There was a general cry of greeting as Hermione flung her arms around him, Ron clapped him on the back, and Hagrid said, ""All righ', Harry?"
30771,"Dudley sobbed on it after I saved him from the dementors ..."
30706,"Finally Uncle Vernon blurted out, ""But what about my work?"
30666,"Sixteen years of being addressed thus left Harry in no doubt when his uncle was calling, nevertheless, he did not immediately respond."
30655,"Revulsion and fury rose in him like vomit; he balled up the newspaper and threw it, with all his force, at the wall, where it joined the rest of the rubbish heaped around his overflowing bin.He began to stride blindly around the room, opening empty drawers and picking up books only to replace them on the same piles, barely conscious of what he was doing, as random phrases from Rita's article echoed in his head: An entire chapter to the whole Potter-Dumbledore relationship..."
30590,"On the very eve of our trip, Albus's mother, Kendra, died, leaving Albus the head, and sole breadwinner, of the family."
30585,"They rubbed along as comfortably as two such different boys could do."
30582,"Though it was often predicted in later years that he was on the point of taking the job, however, he never had Ministerial ambitions.Three years after we had started at Hogwarts, Albus's brother, Aberforth, arrived at school."
30454,"The room's usual furniture had been pushed carelessly up against the walls."
30440,"The two men appeared out of nowhere, a few yards apart in the narrow, moonlit lane."
30409,"We had our disagree-ments, as you know, but no one knows better than 1 -' ?"
30329,"Then there was Madame Maxime, who took up two-and-a-half chairs on her own, Tom, the landlord of the Leaky Cauldron, Arabella Figg, Harry's Squib neighbour, the hairy bass player from the wizardmg group the Weird bisters, hrnie Frang, dnver ol the Knight Bus, Madam Malkin, of the robe shop in Diagon Alley, and some people whom Harry merely knew by sight, such as the barman of the Hog's Head and the witch who pushed the trolley on the Hogwarts Express."
30291,"Tobias Snape was a Muggie from what it said in the Prophet' 'Yeah, that fits,' said Harry."
30197,"There will probably be some contamination, Arthur,"" .said Lupin."
30168,"Anyway,"" Ginny went on, ""he must have been checking whether the coast was clear to let the Death Eaters out, because the moment he saw us he threw something into the air and it all went pitch-black -""""- Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder,"" said Ron bitterly."
30114,"He obeyed its pressure without really thinking about it."
30037,"Harry scrambled up from the floor and began to sprint along the corridor, ignoring the bangs issuing from behind him, the yells of the others to come back, and the mute call of the figures on the ground whose fate he did not yet know. . . ."
29966,"Hogsmeade, someone who was able to slip Katie the - the - aaaah Dumbledore closed his eyes again and nodded, as though he was about to fall asleep."
29883,"The moment that Dum-bledore reached the bank he let his wand hand fall; the ring of fire vanished, but the Inferi did not emerge again from the water."
29876,"Wordlessly, he gestured to Harry to come to his side."
29858,"Once more, for a second, clear wa-ter gleamed within it, but as he approached Dumbledores mouth, the water vanished again."
29856,"The goblet filled with clear water; Harry dropped to his knees beside Dumbledore, raised his head, and brought the glass to his lips  -  but it was empty."
29843,"Harry reached forward and grasped the crystal cup, holding it steady."
29836,"Dumbledore plunged the glass blindly back into the basin, refilled it, and drank once more."
29814,"He met an invisible barrier that prevented him coming within an inch of it."
29751,"A misty greenish light shone far away in what looked like the mid-dle of the lake; it was reflected in the completely still water below."
29728,"A little way in, the passageway curved to the left, and Harry saw that it extended far into the cliff."
29725,"Taking deep breaths that filled his nostrils with the tang of salt and seaweed, he struck out for the shimmering, shrinking light now moving deeper into the cliff."
29724,"The water was icy; Harry's waterlogged clothes billowed around him and weighed him down."
29700,"A minute later they turned the corner into the side street where the Hog's Head's sign creaked a little, though there was no breeze."
29654,"It was as difficult to stop his relentless pacing as to refrain from shouting."
29639,"She looked alarmed as he ran past her, round the corner into Dumbledore's corridor, where the lone gargoyle stood sentry."
29569,"You'd think people had better things to gossip about,' said Ginny, as she sat on the common-room floor, leaning against Harry's legs and reading the Daily Prophet."
29483,"Ron was standing at the top of the stairs, looking bewildered at , the sight of Harry."
29476,"He felt stunned; it was as though a beloved pet had turned suddenly savage; what had the Prince been thinking to copy such a spell into his book?"
29425,"Somehow, the game had become inextricably linked in Harry's mind with success or failure in his plans for Ginny."
29413,"Yet Harry could not help himself talking to Ginny, laughing with her, walking back from practice with her; however much his conscience ached, he found himself wondering how best to get her on her own."
29334,"After an interval of some years, however, he used Nagini to kill an old Muggle man, and it might then have occurred to him to turn her into his last Horcrux."
29330,"He believed that in killing you, he was destroying the danger the prophecy had outlined."
29315,"However, a withered hand does not seem an unreasonable exchange for a sev-enth of Voldemort's soul."
29229,"He put his other hand inside his cloak and took out a small, empty bottle."
29199,"He refilled Hagrid's mug and his own, and questioned him about the creatures that lived in the forest these days and how Hagrid was able to look after them all."
29160,"If the beast only just died it might not yet have dried out. . . ."
29143,"His feeling of elation in-creasing, Harry strode off through the castle."
29086,"Harry's heart sank as he took the small scroll of parchment."
29064,"It gave Harry a most agreeable feeling of power as he tried to remember what form of words he had not yet tried."
29052,"Twice, Harry had gone to his office and knocked, but received no reply, though on the second occasion he was sure he had heard the quickly stifled sounds of an old gramophone."
29050,"However, he had decided to use the time to attempt another assault on the Room of Requirement."
28964,"Harry was still burning with curiosity and even though Dumbledore had walked to the door and was holding it open for him, he did not move at once."
28899,"Harry edged forward a little to get a better view and saw what looked like a small golden cup with two finely wrought handles."
28835,"The gargoyle leapt aside at the mention of toffee eclairs, and Harry took the spiral staircase two steps at a time, knocking on the door just as a clock within chimed eight."
28802,"That had been his most painful injury by far ... he remembered the agony of regrowing an armful of bones in one night, a discomfort not eased by the arrival of an unexpected visitor in the middle of the  - Harry sat bolt upright, his heart pounding, his bandage turban askew."
28746,"And speaking of getting shot of people,"" Harry added, getting to his feet and picking up his Firebolt, ""will you stop pretending to be asleep when Lavender comes to see you?"
28704,"I never said tha',"" said Hagrid, though his look of panic could not have been a bigger giveaway."
28637,"Ron yelled as his heel was wrenched upwards once more; he dangled helplessly, upside-down, his robes hanging off him."
28626,"Friends they might be, but if Ron started calling Lavender 'Lav-Lav', he would have to pui his foot down."
28595,"He had found it, a folded square of apparently blank parchment, which he now smoothed out and tapped with [he tip of his wand."
28496,"Hermione's expression could not have been any smugger; she had loathed being out-performed in every Potions class."
28406,"For a few seconds they looked at each other, then the man staggered upright, the many empty bottles at his feet clattering and tinkling across the floor."
28372,"He was placed in Slytherin House almost the moment that the Sorting Hat touched his head,"" continued Dumbledore, waving his blackened hand toward the shelf over his head where the Sorting Hat sat, ancient and unmoving."
28371,"You will remember how excited he was to hear that he was a wizard, that he refused my company on a trip to Diagon Alley, and that I, in turn, warned him against continued thievery when he arrived at school."
28337,"Without a word, Hermione sped up to walk with Neville."
28316,"When Ginny had arrived, all three of them trooped out of McGonagall's office and off toward Gryffindor Tower."
28315,"Harry straightened his glasses and flattened his hair as Ron came spinning into view."
28300,"There, shining white on the back of his cold hand, were the scars which Dolores Umbridge had forced him to carve into his own flesh: I must not tell lies."
28268,"Nobody seemed to find Scrimgeour's pretense that he did not know Harry's name convincing, or find it natural that he should be chosen to accompany the Minister around the garden when Ginny, Fleur, and George also had clean plates."
28243,"A moment later, Harry had given a loud yell and leapt out of his camp bed; the package contained a large number of maggots."
28202,"It comes down to whether or not you trust Dumbledore's judgment."
28115,"If you were prepared to grant me a few interviews, say in four- or five-hour sessions, why, we could have the book finished within months."
28086,"And sure enough, in no time at all the whole school seemed to know that Harry Potter was taking Luna Lovegood to Slughorn's party."
27998,"It was full of golden potion and the cork was still tightly sealed with wax."
27981,"His shoulder aching, Harry raced after him, de-termined to ram him back. ..."
27940,"The Gryffindor table, a solid mass of red and gold, cheered as Harry and Ron approached."
27924,"Harry spent the day attempting to keep the peace between Ron and Hermione with no success; finally, Hermione departed for bed in high dudgeon, and Ron stalked off to the boys' dormitory after swearing angrily at several frightened first years for looking at him."
27911,"Neither of them mentioned Ginny or Hermione again; indeed, they barely spoke to each other that evening and got into bed in si-lence, each absorbed in his own thoughts, Harry lay awake for a long time, looking up at the canopy of his four-poster and trying to convince himself that his feelings for Ginny were entirely elder-brotherly."
27841,"At once, the prickly vines shot back inside, and the gnarled stump sat there looking like an innocently dead lump of wood."
27840,"One tangled itself in Hermione's hair, and Ron beat it back with a pair of secateurs; Harry succeeded in trapping a couple of vines and knotting them together; a hole opened in the middle of all the tentaclelike branches; Hermione plunged her arm bravely into this hole, which closed like a trap around her elbow; Harry and Ron tugged and wrenched at the vines, forcing the hole to open again, and Hermi-one snatched her arm free, clutching in her fingers a pod just like Neville's."
27751,"After a few seconds Riddle stopped glaring, though he looked, if anything, warier still."
27747,"He was pointing at the door through which Mrs. Cole had just left."
27699,"It was as shabby as the hallway and the furniture was old and mismatched."
27684,"Having reached their side of the street, he strode off along the pavement, drawing many curious glances due to the flamboyantly cut suit of plum velvet that he was wearing."
27649,"There was no buzz of fear or speculation, however: Clearly, the news of Katie's fate had not yet spread."
27626,"Haltingly, and with many pauses while she attempted to control her crying, Leanne told Professor McGonagall how Katie had gone to the bathroom in the Three Broomsticks and returned holding the unmarked package, how Katie had seemed a little odd, and how they had argued about the advisability of agreeing to deliver unknown objects, the argument culminating in the tussle over the parcel, which tore open."
27617,"As they followed Hermione and Leanne up the road, Harry was thinking furiously."
27605,"Hermione hurried over to Katie's wailing friend and put an arm around her."
27599,"Harry looked around; the landscape seemed deserted."
27571,"Harry swore at the top of his voice, spinning on the spot to see where Mundungus had gone."
27511,"He did not usually lie in bed reading his textbooks; that sort of behavior, as Ron rightly said, was indecent in anybody except Hermione, who was simply weird that way."
27486,"We're having a little party, just a few rising stars, I've got McLaggen com-ing and Zabini, the charming Melinda Bobbin  -  I don't know whether you know her?"
27418,"Harry glanced over at Ron, who had always had a problem with nerves; Harry had hoped that winning their final match last term might have cured it, but apparently not: Ron was a delicate shade of green."
27407,"The third group had a pileup halfway around the pitch."
27399,"He pointed over to the edge of the pitch, close to where Hermi-one was sitting."
27394,"His walk instantly became something more like a strut."
27343,"Perhaps she thought he would stay for the baby's sake."
27337,"The shock of her de-sertion may have contributed to his early death  -  or perhaps he had simply never learned to feed himself."
27286,"She then stood quite still, her back against the wall between the filthy window and the stove, as though she wished for nothing more than to sink into the stone and vanish."
27224,"He was reading a wooden signpost that was sticking out of the brambles on the left-hand side of the road."
27118,"It is probably the most dangerous and powerful potion in this room - oh yes,"" he said, nodding gravely at Maifoy and Nott, both of whom were smirking skeptically."
27081,"He, Ron, and Hermione spent the whole of break speculating on what Dumbledore would teach Harry."
27032,"We got so much homework for Runes,"" she said anxiously when Harry and Ron joined her."
27028,"You mustn't start off like that,"" she said warningly."
26989,"Ron snorted loudly, but managed to pass it off as a violent sneeze."
26977,"With the usual deafening scraping noise, the benches moved back and the hundreds of students began to file out of the Great Hall toward their dormitories."
26968,"Harry, Ron, and Hermione were not the only ones who had been talking; the whole Hall had erupted in a buzz of conversation at the news that Snape had finally achieved his heart's desire."
26957,"Whispers it the room; Dumbledore, interpreting them correctly, merely smiled and shook his purple-and-gold sleeve over his injury."
26868,"As though in slow motion, he toppled out of the luggage rack and fell, with an agonizing, floor-shaking crash, at Malfoy's feet, the Invisibility Cloak trapped beneath him, his whole body revealed with his legs still curled absurdly into the cramped kneeling position."
26777,"At a gesture from Slughorn, they sat down opposite each other in the only two empty seats, which were nearest the door."
26732,"Neville bumped his head against the seat as he emerged from under it."
26674,"Maybe he's broken his Hand of Glory"" said Ron vaguely, as he attempted to straighten his broomstick's bent tail twigs."
26673,"She was sitting on the windowsill in Fred and George's room with her feet up on one of the cardboard boxes and had only grudgingly looked up from her new copy of Advanced Rune Translation."
26657,"She checked her hair in the reflection in the glass, then marched into the shop, setting the bell tinkling again."
26576,"Malfoy made an angry movement toward Harry, but stumbled over his overlong robe."
26496,"And the Defense Against the Dark Arts practical was no good at all."
26461,"The door opened again and Mrs. Weasley popped her head in."
26441,"Its all this uncertainty with You-Know-Who coming back, people think they might be dead tomorrow, so they're rushing all sorts of decisions they'd normally take time over."
26210,"The wreckage of a fallen chandelier flittered nearby."
26177,"Ah yes, of course, I haven't told you,"" said Dumbledore."
26152,"This magic will cease to operate the moment that Harry turns seventeen; in other words, at the moment he becomes a man."
26149,"He has known nothing but neglect and often cruelty at your hands."
26087,"Ah, good evening Harry,"" said Dumbledore, looking up at him through his half-moon glasses with a most satisfied expression."
26050,"Nearby, on the floor, lay a purple leaflet emblazoned with the words: - ISSUED ON BEHALF OF - The Ministry of MagicPROTECTING YOUR HOME AND FAMILY AGAINST DARK FORCESThe Wizarding community is currently under threat from an organization calling itself the Death Eaters."
25925,"Why did you stop the Dark Lord procuring the Sorcerer's Stone?"
25860,"Now, about Herbert Chorley, your Junior Minister,"" he continued."
25842,"The Prime Minister sank, weak-kneed, into the nearest chair."
25818,"And he wasn't in league with He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named either."
25801,"It had not escaped his notice that, despite Fudge's assurances at their first meeting, they were now seeing rather a lot of each other, nor that Fudge was becoming more flustered with each visit."
25787,"The Prime Minister rather resented being told to sit down in his own office, let alone offered his own whiskey, but he sat nevertheless."
25770,"At this, the Prime Minister had found his voice at last."
25725,"A grim mood has gripped the country,"" the opponent had concluded, barely concealing his own broad grin.And unfortunately, this was perfectly true."
25718,"This particular opponent had appeared on the news that very day, not only to enumerate all the terrible things that had happened in the last week (as though anyone needed reminding) but also to explain why each and every one of them was the government's fault."
25688,"As the train slowed down in the approach to King's Cross, Harry thought he had never wanted to leave it less."
25682,"Wanting to impress Cho seemed to belong to a past that was no longer quite connected with him; so much of what he had wanted before Sirius's death felt that way these days . . . the week that had elapsed since he had last seen Sirius seemed to have lasted much, much longer; it stretched across two universes, the one with Sirius in it, and the one without."
25611,"The frustrated face looking back out of the mirror was still, definitely, his own . . ."
25582,"Even though he now understood exactly why he had to return there every summer, he did not feel any better about it."
25421,"I should have recognised that I was too happy to think that I did not have to do it on that particular day . . . you were too young, much too young."
25292,"If I had been open with you, Harry, as I should have been, you would have known a long time ago that Voldemort might try and lure you to the Department of Mysteries, and you would never have been tricked into going there tonight."
25269,"He could see the Quidditch stadium in the distance."
25214,"As Dumbledore pulled him back to his feet, Harry saw the tiny gold statues of the house-elf and the goblin, leading a stunned-looking Cornelius Fudge forward."
25193,"He sent another killing curse at Dumbledore but missed, instead hitting the security guard's desk, which burst into flame."
25175,"Harry roared and, as he shouted it, pain seared across his forehead; his scar was on fire again, and he felt a surge of fury that was quite unconnected with his own rage."
25125,"But as he reached the ground and sprinted towards the dais, Lupin grabbed Harry around the chest, holding him back."
25116,"Harry released Neville, though he was unaware of doing so."
25113,"Harry saw Sirius duck Bellatrix's jet of red light: he was laughing at her."
25084,"The man relinquished Harry at once with a howl of pain."
25064,"Harry's heart sank: Neville was scrambling down the stone benches towards them, Hermione's wand held fast in his trembling hand."
25062,"One was bleeding badly; Dolohov, freed of the Body-Bind Curse, was leering, his wand pointing straight at Harry's face."
25053,"It seemed to have worked; they streaked after him, knocking chairs and tables flying but not daring to bewitch him in case they hurt the prophecy, and he dashed through the only door still open, the one through which the Death Eaters themselves had come; inwardly praying that Neville would stay with Ron and find some way of releasing him."
25046,"The moment they made contact with his skin, the tentacles began wrapping themselves around Ron's arms like ropes."
25009,"Harry fell to his knees beside her as Neville crawled rapidly towards her from under the desk, his wand held up in front of him."
24963,"And then he found someone's toes and pressed down upon them."
24959,"Nothing remained of them or their erstwhile homes but fragments of glass upon the floor."
24925,"The others moved in closer around Harry, gazing at the orb as he brushed it free of the clogging dust."
24916,"He glanced along at the other labels on that stretch of shelf."
24773,"They were descending at last . . . he thought he heard a shriek behind him and twisted around dangerously, but could see no sign of a falling body . . . presumably they had all received a shock from the change of direction, just as he had."
24675,"They backed slowly into the centre of the clearing, Umbridge uttering odd little whimpers of terror."
24643,"Ginny was staring at Hermione as though she had never seen her before."
24613,"Ron's lip was bleeding on to Umbridge's carpet as he struggled against Warrington's half-nelson; Ginny was still trying to stamp on the feel of the sixth-year girl who had both her upper arms in a tight grip; Neville was turning steadily more purple in the face while lugging at Crabbe's arms; and Hermione was attempting, in vain, to throw Millicent Bulstrode off her."
24522,"Harry, think about this,' said Hermione, taking a step towards him, 'its five o'clock in the afternoon . . . the Ministry of Magic must be full of workers . . . how would Voldemort and Sirius have got in without being seen?"
24405,"Then somebody coughed behind him, and he remembered that he was halfway through an exam."
24372,"I don't know how they got it through that new door, but I just walked past there and Umbridge is shrieking her head off - by the sound of it, it tried to take a chunk out of her leg - '    'Good,' said Harry and Ron together."
24345,"Harry walked into the Great Hall, clutching his wand so tightly his hand shook."
24329,"Harry went to bed early but then lay awake for what felt like hours."
24288,"She was not the only person acting oddly as the OWLs drew steadily nearer."
24249,"Harry saw that she looked much the worse for wear; her hair was full of twigs and leaves, her robes were ripped in several places and there were numerous scratches on her face and arms."
24212,"He had now seized the top of the pine tree and was pulling it towards him, evidently for the simple pleasure of seeing how far it would spring back when he let go."
24205,"Harry heard Hermione squeal, terrified, beside him."
24155,"Yeh know she's bin lookin' fer a chance ter get rid of me ever since I got back."
24147,"The breaking of a twig echoed loudly and the tiniest rustle of movement, even though it might have been made by an innocent sparrow, caused Harry to peer through the gloom for a culprit."
24086,"Ron snorted disbelievingly and Hermione threw him a very dirty look."
24074,"Peeves smashed lanterns and snuffed out candles, juggled burning torches over the heads of screaming students, caused neatly stacked piles of parchment to topple into fires or out of windows; flooded the second floor when he pulled off all the taps in the bathrooms, dropped a bag of tarantulas in the middle of the Great Hall during breakfast and, whenever he fancied a break, spent hours at a time floating along after Umbridge and blowing loud raspberries every time she spoke."
24071,"Alter putting four successive classes in detention and failing to discover their secret, she was forced to give up and allow the bleeding, swooning, sweating and vomiting students to leave her classes in droves."
24055,"For one thing, they had not left instructions on how to remove the swamp that now filled the corridor on the fifth floor of the east wing."
23982,"Harry's heart beat very fast as he left the classroom."
23943,"Her hands shook slightly as she shuffled the many pamphlets littering her desk."
23901,"He looked round; Fred and George had come to join them."
23888,"He did not understand why an Easter egg should have made him feel like this."
23874,"Whenever someone had told him he was like James, he had glowed with pride inside."
23868,"Hadn't James started it all simply because Sirius had said he was bored?"
23842,"Wincing, Harry looked round to see who had hold of him, and saw, with a thrill of horror, a fully grown, adult-sized Snape standing right beside him, white with rage."
23841,"A hand had closed tight over his upper arm, closed with a pincer-like grip."
23733,"He was falling through cold blackness, spinning furiously as he went, and then - '    He was standing in the middle of the Great Hall, but the four house tables were gone."
23691,"Halfway across the Entrance Hall, however, Cho came hurrying up to him."
23689,"Hermione kept asking him what was wrong whenever he fell silent trying to rid himself of all thought and emotion and, after all, the best moment to empty his brain was not while teachers were firing revision questions at the class."
23671,"Now he was in a long, rectangular room full of an odd mechanical clicking."
23595,"I've been telling Dumbledore for years and years he's too soft with you all,' said Filch, chuckling nastily."
23560,"A few of the portraits hissed at him; one or two even made rude hand gestures."
23500,"And then - to Harry's utter amazement - 'Marietta shook her head."
23428,"Harry could hear them sprinting along the corridors and hoped they had the sense not to try and make it all the way to their dormitories."
23355,"He wondered whether it had been Bane who had kicked Firenze in the chest."
23353,"There was a pause, then Parvati raised her hand again."
23299,"Harry pushed forwards through a knot of tall Slytherins and saw that the onlookers had formed a great ring, some of them looking shocked, others even frightened."
23259,"A couple of weeks after his dream of Rookwood, Harry was to be found, yet again, kneeling on the floor of Snape's office, trying to clear his head."
23222,"Ron    looked as though he had just been getting ready for bed; one arm was out of his robes."
23144,"There, at the far end of the windowless passage, was a plain, black door."
23140,"He dreamed that Neville and Professor Sprout were waltzing around the Room of Requirement while Professor McGonagall played the bagpipes."
23129,"Out of respect for his feelings, Harry waited a while before going up to the dormitory himself, so that Ron could pretend to be asleep if he wanted to Sure enough, when Harry finally entered the room Ron was snoring a little too loudly to be entirely plausible."
23123,"Anyway, once you're back, I think    I'll, try out for Chaser."
23105,"Hermione glanced over at the back of Clio's head and sighed."
23101,"Cho Chang walked into the Hall with her friend Marietta."
23081,"Rita sat up straight again, her eyebrows raised, and drained her glass of Firewhisky,    The Prophet exists to sell itself, you silly girl,' she said coldly    'My dad thinks it's an awful paper,' said Luna, chipping into the conversation unexpectedly."
23071,"Then she said baldly, The Prophet wouldn't print it."
22972,"Scrivenshaft's; cold, heavy drops of water kept hitting Harry's face and the back of his neck."
22970,"The ten escaped Death Eaters were staring out of every shop window he and Cho passed."
22925,"On the contrary, Harry felt he was getting \vorse with every lesson."
22909,"Several times he passed her in the corridors - in itself a very unusual occurrence as she generally remained in her tower room - muttering wildly to herself, wringing her hands and shooting terrified glances over her shoulder, and all the while giving off a powerful smell of cooking sherry."
22907,"She lurked by the fire in the heavily perfumed tower room, interrupting Professor Trelawney's increasingly hysterical talks with difficult questions about ornithomancy and heptomology, insisting that she predicted students' answers before they gave them and demanding that she demonstrate her skill at the crystal ball, the tea leaves and the rune stones in turn."
22895,"In their confusion and fear, these doubters now seemed to be turning to the only other explanation available to them: the one that Harry and Dumbledore had been expounding since the previous year."
22890,"Rumours were flying that some of the convicts had been spotted in Hogsmeade, that they were supposed to be hiding out in the Shrieking Shack and that they were going to break into Hogwarts, just as Sirius Black had once done."
22799,"As he opened it, he glanced back at Snape, who had his back to Harry and was scooping his own thoughts out of the Pensieve with the tip of his wand and replacing them carefully inside his own head."
22762,"Cho Chang was drawing nearer to him under the mistletoe . . ."
22749,"The important point is that the Dark Lord is now aware that you are gaining access to his thoughts and feelings."
22714,"He paused outside the door when he reached it, wishing he were almost anywhere else, then, taking a deep breath, he knocked and entered."
22695,"At last they rolled to a halt outside the gates to Hogwarts."
22605,"Crookshanks, whom Hermione had been restraining with difficulty for the past quarter of an hour, leapt gleefully on to the board and set the pieces running for cover, squealing at the top of their voices."
22530,"Hermione, Ron and Ginny almost sprinted to the door with him."
22529,"Lupin strolled away from the bed and over to the werewolf, who had no visitors and was looking rather wistfully at the crowd around Mr Weasley; Bill muttered something s.bout getting himself a cup of tea and Fred and George leapt up to accompany him, grinning."
22502,"Here and there among the material were stale bread crusts and mouldy old bits of cheese."
22463,"When he entered the bedroom, he was rather surprised to see both Ron and Ginny waiting for them, sitting on Ron's bed."
22434,"Fuming, Harry dragged his trunk back to the foot of his bed, then threw himself face down on the moth-eaten covers, his eyes shut, his body heavy and aching."
22352,"A harassed-looking wizard was holding his small daughter tightly by the ankle while she flapped around his head using the immensely large, feathery wings that had sprouted right out through the back of her romper suit."
22305,"He could only see a sliver of Sirius's face; the rest was in darkness."
22294,"George and Ginny got up, walked swiftly over to their mother and hugged her."
22242,"The only sources of light were the fire and one guttering candle, which illuminated the remains of a solitary supper."
22228,"When the clever-looking wizard continued to feign sleep, some of them shouted his name, too."
22153,"He clutched his head in his hands; the pain was blinding him . . . he rolled right over and vomited over the edge of the mattress."
22125,"They pulled off their robes and put on pyjamas in silence; Dean, Seamus and Neville were already asleep."
22049,"After ten minutes on the Impediment Jinx, they laid out cushions all over the floor and started practising Stunning again."
22025,"The only thing he really looked forward to were the DA meetings, and they would have to stop over the holidays, as nearly everybody in the DA would be spending the time with their families."
21941,"He withdrew his head sharply, his face covered in snow."
21713,"The howling and jeering of the crowd grew fainter and fainter until they reached the Entrance Hall, where they could hear nothing except the sound of their own footsteps."
21708,"Harry looked around for Madam Hooch, but she was still berating Crabbe for his illegal Bludger attack."
21697,"He heard Madam Hooch's shrill whistle, an uproar in the stands compounded of catcalls, angry yells and jeering, a thud, then Angelina's frantic voice."
21685,"There was an edge of panic in Harry's desire to find the Snitch now."
21645,"Harry looked up: Luna Lovegood had drifted over from the Ravenclaw table."
21612,"I prefer your way,' said Harry, grinning, as he slipped his; Galleon into his pocket."
21553,"I was thinking, the first thing we should do is Expelliarmus, you know, the Disarming Charm."
21524,"Fifth-years were allowed to be out in the corridors until nine o'clock, but all three of them kept looking around nervously as they made their way along the seventh floor."
21518,"When he looked up to take a drink of pumpkin juice, he found Hermione watching him."
21480,"These plantes are moste efficacious in the inflaming of the braine, and are therefore much used in Confusing and Befuddlement Draughts, where the wizard is desirous of producing hot-headedness and recklessness . . .    . . ."
21471,"Harry had not thought about those words in weeks; he had been too absorbed in what was going on at Hogwarts, too busy dwelling on the ongoing battles with Umbridge, the injustice of all the Ministry interference . . . but now they came back to him and made him wonder . . ."
21398,"Well then, it would be a perfect way for Umbridge to manage it - tip off Filch, let him do the dirty work and confiscate the letter, then either find a way of stealing it from him or else demand to see it - I don't think Filch would object, when's he ever stuck up for a student's rights?"
21368,"The Ministry's forced through another decree, which means we're not allowed to have Quidditch teams - '    'Or secret Defence Against the Dark Arts groups?"
21308,"Neville said nothing; he merely snatched up his own bag and stalked off into the dungeon."
21306,"Release Longbottom, Potter, or it will be detention."
21218,"He kept reliving Saturdays meeting in his mind: all those people, coming to him to learn Defence Against the Dark Arts . . . and the looks on their faces as they had heard some of the things he had done . . . and Cho praising his performance in the Triwizard Tournament - knowing all those people did not think him a lying weirdo, but someone to be admired, buoyed him up so much that he was still cheerful on Monday morning, despite the imminent prospect of all his least favourite classes."
21165,"There was a murmur of impressed agreement around the table."
21155,"This was, he felt, all her fault; she had decided to display him like some sort of freak and of course they had all turned up to see just now wild his story was."
21111,"And I've looked up everything I can think of about study groups and homework groups and they're definitely allowed."
21105,"At the time Harry had wondered why Hagrid had not found it odd that the stranger kept his face hidden throughout their encounter; now he saw that keeping your face hidden was something of a fashion in the Hog's Head."
21063,"Sometimes it seemed an insane idea, just as it had on the night Hermione had proposed it, but at others, he had found himself thinking about the spells that had served him best in his various encounters with Dark creatures and Death Eaters - found himself, in fact, subconsciously planning lessons . . ."
21058,"In the Hog's HeadHermione made no mention of Harry giving Defence Against the Dark Arts lessons for two whole weeks after her original suggestion."
20975,"Angelina gave Harry a look of deepest disgust and stalked away, upon which he flung himself on to the bench beside Ron, fuming."
20966,"She walked back to the front of the class and stood before them, all the jauntiness she had shown at the beginning of the lesson gone."
20954,"And by the time she had interpreted Harry's dreams at the top of her voice (all of which, even the ones that involved eating porridge, apparently foretold a gruesome and early death), he was feeling much less sympathetic towards her."
20773,"Crabbe, Goyle and Pansy Parkinson guffawed and shrieked with laughter."
20731,"At the entrance of a corridor that led towards the west wing of the castle, Cho said, 'I'm going this way."
20722,"He stopped with his hand on the handle and looked back at Harry."
20705,"She coaxed it down on to her arm where it held out an obliging leg so that she could attach the parcel."
20667,"We've got a new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, Professor Umbridge."
20665,"How was he supposed to tell Sirius everything that had happened over the past week and pose all the questions he was burning to ask without giving potential letter-thieves a lot of information he did not want them to have?"
20654,"Percy and PadfootHarry was first to wake up in his dormitory next morning."
20646,"Harry watched Fred, George and Lee Jordan juggling empty Butterbeer bottles for a moment."
20630,"Ron came running towards him, beaming all over his face and slopping Butterbeer down his front from the goblet he was clutching."
20589,"Though Harry automatically glanced towards the staff table when he entered the Great Hall, it was without any real hope of seeing Hagrid, and he turned his mind immediately to his more pressing problems, such as the mountainous pile of homework he had to do and the prospect of yet another detention with Umbridge."
20566,"His homework situation, however, was now desperate, and when he returned to the Gryffindor common room he did not, though exhausted, go to bed, but opened his books and began Snape's moonstone essay."
20506,"He had not noticed her at first because she was wearing a luridly flowered set of robes that blended only too well with the tablecloth on the desk behind her."
20497,"He had known this office under three of its previous occupants."
20443,"Professor Grubbly-Plank stood waiting for the class some ten yards from Hagrid's front door, a long trestle table in front of her laden with twigs."
20354,"Her eyes zoomed from side to side behind their square spectacles as she read what Umbridge had written, and with each line they became narrower."
20351,"A door to his left flew open and Professor McGonagall emerged from her office looking grim and slightly harassed."
20343,"Professor Umbridge pulled a small roll of pink parchment out of her handbag, stretched it out on the desk, dipped her quill into a bottle of ink and started scribbling, hunched over so that Harry could not see what she was writing."
20342,"He felt so angry he did not care what happened next."
20310,"As long as you have studied the theory hard enough, there is no reason why you should not be able to perform the spells under carefully controlled examination conditions,' said Professor Umbridge dismissively."
20275,"We will be following a carefully structured, theory-centred, Ministry-approved course of defensive magic this year."
20252,"Her voice trailed away delicately, leaving them all in no doubt that Professor Trelawney considered her subject above such sordid matters as examinations."
20251,"If you have the Seeing Eye, certificates and grades matter very little."
20236,"And abandoning his shepherd's pie, he swung his schoolbag back over his shoulder and left them sitting there."
20178,"Harry emerged from under the table to see Fred and George walking away, each carrying a stack of toast."
20142,"They are the limit,' said Hermione grimly, taking down the sign, which Fred and George had pinned up ewer a poster giving the date of the first Hogsmeade weekend, which was to be in October."
20140,"Pocket money failing to keep pace with your outgoings?"
20102,"He felt vaguely as though something was closing in on him."
20084,"Of course everyone was staring at him; he had emerged from the Triwizard maze two months previously clutching the dead body of a fellow student and claiming to have seen Lord Voldemort return to power."
20082,"He kept his eyes fixed ahead as he wove his way through the crowd in the Entrance Hall, then he hurried up the marble staircase, took a couple of concealed short cuts and had soon left most of the crowds behind."
20059,"The quiet that always filled the Hall when Dumbledore was speaking was breaking up as students put t heir heads together, whispering and giggling."
20030,"Harry was too used to their bickering to bother trying to reconcile them; he felt it was a better use of his time to eat his way steadily through his steak and kidney pie, then a large plateful of his favourite treacle tart."
19992,"That meant the first-years must have crossed the lake and reached the castle, and sure enough, a few seconds later, the doors from the Entrance Hall opened."
19947,"Harry said, as he, Ron and Luna made for the carriage in which Hermione and Ginny were already sitting."
19943,"Seconds later, Hermione emerged panting from the crowd."
19916,"Harry saw Ron checking his reflection in the black window."
19880,"Startling new evidence has recently come to light that Sirius Black may not have committed the crimes for which he was sent to Azhaban."
19876,"For fourteen years Sirius Black has been believed guilty of the mass murder of twelve innocent Muggles and one wizard."
19831,"He dumped the toad into Harry's lap and took a quill from his schoolbag."
19802,"She slid the door open and pulled her trunk inside."
19799,"In the very last carriage they met Neville Longbottom, Harry's fellow fifth-year Gryffindor, his round face shining with the effort of pulling his trunk along and maintaining a one-handed grip on his struggling toad, Trevor."
19783,"They had almost unloaded Moody's luggage trolley when Fred, George and Ginny turned up with Lupin."
19778,"Once inside the station they lingered casually beside the barrier between platforms nine and ten until the coast was clear, then each of them leaned against it in turn and fell easily through on to platform nine and three-quarters, where the Hogwarts Express stood belching sooty steam over a platform packed with departing students and their families."
19757,"He awoke abruptly with his scar prickling to find Ron already dressed and talking to him."
19664,"All at once the party seemed much more enjoyable; he loaded up his plate, feeling doubly fond of everyone in the room."
19607,"Not this, said a small and truthful voice inside his head."
19597,"He turned to his bed, picked up the pile of clean robes Mrs Weasley had laid on it and crossed the room to his trunk."
19595,"He dashed from the room, leaving Harry and Hermione alone."
19592,"She gave Ron yet another kiss on the cheek, sniffed loudly, and bustled from the room."
19583,"Fred's words took a moment to penetrate Mrs Weasley's preoccupation with pyjamas."
19538,"Eric the watchwizard was hidden behind his Daily Prophet again."
19535,"The lift arrived; it was empty except for a flock of memos that flapped around Mr Weasley's head as he pressed the button for the Atrium and the doors clanged shut."
19510,"Cornelius Fudge and the toadlike witch were almost the last to leave the dungeon."
19471,"It could not have been plainer that not one of them was really amused."
19464,"She was rather squat with a broad, flabby face, as little neck as Uncle Vernon and a very wide, slack mouth."
19416,"The Wizengamot was still muttering and fidgeting restlessly; only when Fudge spoke again did they settle down."
19403,"Ron's brother Percy was sitting at the very end of the front bench."
19332,"One of the wizards in the lift, who was carrying an armful of broomsticks, extricated himself with difficulty and disappeared down the corridor."
19315,"Seated at a desk to the left, beneath a sign saying Security, a badly-shaven wizard in peacock blue robes looked up as they approached and put down his Daily Prophet."
19297,"Harry watched apprehensively as the pavement seemed to rise up past the glass windows of the telephone box until darkness closed over their heads."
19171,"Harry, however, did not laugh; he was too busy staring at the names to the right of Andromeda's burn mark."
19162,"Or on Voldemort's orders, more likely; I doubt Regulus was ever important enough to be killed by Voldemort in person."
18946,"The thing Harry had taken to be a pile of rags gave a prolonged, grunting snore, then jerked awake."
18934,"A haze of pipe smoke hung in the air like battle fumes, through which loomed the menacing shapes of heavy iron pots and pans hanging from the dark ceiling."
18933,"Most of the light was coming from a large fire at the far end of the room."
18932,"It was scarcely less gloomy than the hall above, a cavernous room with rough stone walls."
18922,"Lupin and Mrs Weasley darted forward and tried to tug the curtains shut over the old woman, but they would not close and she screeched louder than ever, brandishing clawed hands as though trying to tear at their faces."
18893,"Fred gave the Extendable Ear a hearty tug; there was another loud crack and he and George vanished."
18864,"That's exactly what we wondered,' said Ron, who seemed very keen to keep normal conversation going now that Harry had stopped yelling."
18845,"We know some of the Order are following known Death Eaters, keeping tabs on them, you know - '    'Some of them are working on recruiting more people to the Order - ' said Hermione."
18765,"It said:    The Headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix may be found at number twelve, Grimmauld Place, London."
18739,"He wished he had thought to put on a coat; he was starting to shiver."
18716,"Harry looked down at his body, or rather, what had been his body, for it didn't look anything like his any more."
18695,"Books, clothes, telescope and scales all soared into the air and flew pell-mell into the trunk."
18635,"A wand-tip flared, illuminating the hall with magical light."
18568,"Up and down he paced, consumed with anger and frustration, grinding his teeth and clenching his fists, casting angry looks out at the empty, star-strewn sky every time he passed the window."
18417,"Ministry representatives will be calling at your place of residence shortly to destroy your wand."
18404,"The severity of this breach of the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery has resulted in your expulsion from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry."
18364,"It wasn't easy, you know . . . but oh my word,' she said tragically, wringing her hands once more, 'when Dumbledore hears about this - how could Mundungus have left, he was supposed to be on duty until midnight - where is he?"
18310,"Harry yelled, his eyes watering with pain as he scrambled to his hands and knees, feeling around frantically n the blackness."
18300,"The cold was so intense he was shivering all over; goose bumps had erupted up his arms and the hairs on the back of his neck were standing up - he opened his eyes to their fullest extent, staring blankly around, unseeing."
18293,"The distant rumble of cars and the whisper of trees had gone."
18254,"Harry waited for the rest of the gang to move on before setting off again."
18232,"Harry watched the dark figures crossing the grass and wondered who they had been beating up tonight."
18215,"In the past, his scar hurting had warned that Voldemort was getting stronger again, but now that Voldemort was back they would probably remind him that its regular irritation was only to be expected . . . nothing to worry about . . . old news . . ."
18202,"Keep your nose clean and everything will be OK . . ."
18163,"He would have to face his aunt and uncle later and pay the price for his rudeness, but he: did not care very much just at the moment; he had much more pressing matters on his mind."
18150,"There was no sign of what had caused the loud cracking noise, but there were several faces peering through various nearby windows."
18122,"Harry listened to a jingle about Fruit 'n' Bran breakfast cereal while he watched Mrs Figg, a batty cat-loving old lady from nearby Wisteria Walk, amble slowly past."
18113,"He was a skinny, black-haired, bespectacled boy who had the pinched, slightly unhealthy look of someone who has grown a lot in a short space of time."
18110,"Cars that were usually gleaming stood dusty in their drives and lawns that were once emerald green lay parched and yellowing - 'for the use of hosepipes had been banned due to drought."
18086,"They say you drew with Diggory, and Bagman was betting you'd win outright."
17984,"Dumbledore turned gravely to Harry and raised his goblet once more."
17942,"When he, Ron, and Hermione entered the Hall, they saw at once that the usual decorations were missing."
17798,"But now a short, angry wizard stood before him, refusing, point-blank, to accept the prospect of disruption in his comfortable and ordered world - to believe that Voldemort could have risen."
17739,"Mrs. Weasleys eyes filled with tears as she smoothed his bed-covers unnecessarily."
17685,"But when he reached the part where the golden beam of light had connected his and Voldemort's wands, he found his throat obstructed."
17650,"So tired every bone in his body was aching, he wanted nothing more than to sit here, undisturbed, for hours and hours, until he fell asleep and didn't have to think or feel anymore."
17647,"His hands shook as he helped Harry into a chair in front of the desk."
17627,"Harry got up and swayed again; the pain in his leg, which he had not noticed all the time he had been listening to Crouch, now returned in full measure."
17623,"Then go down into the grounds, find Cornelius Fudge, and bring him up to this office."
17411,"He had seen him in Dumbledore's Pensieve, had watched him being led away from court by the dementors, trying to convince Mr. Crouch that he was innocent. . . but he was lined around the eyes now and looked much older. . . ."
17389,"He was looking down into a kind of pit, an underground room, and lying on the floor some ten feet below, apparently fast asleep, thin and starved in appearance, was the real Mad-Eye Moody."
17371,"Snape followed him, looking into the Foe-Glass, where his own face was still visible, glaring into the room."
17343,"Moodys wand was still pointing directly at Harry's heart."
17334,"It would have told you all you needed to know about gillyweed."
17322,"The second task . . . that was when I was most afraid we would fail."
17301,"Those treacherous cowards who wouldn't even brave Azkaban for him."
17298,"At the same time, Moody drew out his wand and pointed it at Harry."
17289,"His sleeve was ripped where Wormtail's dagger had torn it."
17284,"Moody's office came into sharper focus, and so did Moody himself. ..."
17282,"Harry heard a key scrape in a lock and felt a cup being pushed into his hands."
17189,"And as he heard Voldemort draw nearer still, he knew one thing only, and it was beyond fear or reason: He was not going to die crouching here like a child playing hide-and-seek; he was not going to die kneeling at Voldemort s feet... he was going to die upright like his father, and he was going to die trying to defend himself, even if no defense was possible. . . ."
17156,"He had never learned anything that could possibly fit him for this."
17119,"But I was willing to embrace mortal life again, before chasing immortality."
17094,"A wizard -young, foolish, and gullible - wandered across my path in the forest I had made my home."
17075,"His mother died in the attempt to save him - and unwittingly provided him with a protection I admit I had not foreseen. ..."
17069,"The Death Eaters stirred, and Harry saw their eyes dart sideways at one another through their masks."
17050,"His breathing harsh and ragged, he raised his head and stared in disbelief at the silver hand, now attached seamlessly to his arm, as though he were wearing a dazzling glove."
17012,"Between graves, behind the yew tree, in every shadowy space, wizards were Apparating."
16983,"The thin man stepped out of the cauldron, staring at Harry . . . and Harry stared back into the face that had haunted his nightmares for three years."
16946,"Its arms and legs were thin and feeble, and its face - no child alive ever had a face like that - flat and snakelike, with gleaming red eyes."
16911,"Harry saw the name upon it flickering in the wandlight before he was forced around and slammed against it."
16896,"And - several paces nearer, the gap between them closing all the time - Harry saw that the thing in the persons arms looked like a baby ... or was it merely a bundle of robes?"
16858,"He felt angry; his leg was very painful, he was aching all over from trying to throw off the spider, and after all his efforts, Cedric had beaten him to it, just as he'd beaten Harry to ask Cho to the ball."
16785,"Harry and Cedric stood there in the darkness for a moment, looking around them."
16783,"I thought he was all right,"" Harry said, staring at Krum."
16729,"Below him the dark, star-spangled heavens stretched endlessly."
16692,"It felt as though the maze were luring him into a false sense of security."
16656,"There was a gap right in front of them: the entrance to the vast maze."
16636,"They seem to think there's a chance they weren't genuinely written by him."
16584,"But he's made friends with werewolves and giants too."
16577,"Alarming evidence has recently come to light about Harry Potter's strange behavior, which casts doubts upon his suitability to compete in a demanding competition like the Triwizard Tournament, or even to attend Hogwarts School."
16552,"Crabbe and Goyle seemed to be keeping a lookout; both were smirking."
16375,"She had short blonde hair, was wearing magenta robes, and was sucking the end of an acid-green quill."
16312,"That time, he had fallen through a page in an enchanted diary, right into somebody else's memory . . . and unless he was very much mistaken, something of the sort had happened again..."
16195,"He could hear an insect humming gently somewhere behind the curtain."
16171,"Harry was concentrating on the Stunning Spell, which he had never used before."
16147,"The topmost sail of the Durmstrang ship was visible through it."
16081,"Headmaster,"" Hagrid said, staring menacingly at Karkaroff, who was still sprawled at the foot of the tree, tangled in furs and tree roots."
16004,"That man too had been conversing wildly with thin air; Aunt Petunia had seized Dudley's hand and pulled him across the road to avoid him; Uncle Vernon had then treated the family to a long rant about what he would like to do with beggars and vagrants."
15923,"Hermione was having a lot of difficulty managing her knife and fork, her fingers were so stiff and swollen."
15912,"Ron, however, was frowning at the chocolate Hagrid had given him."
15872,"Hagrid leaned upon his spade, but did not seem keen to prolong their talk, because Madame Maxime returned to the carriage shortly afterward."
15829,"Here he allowed each of them to pat him on the head, before turning and setting off at a run around the outskirts of the village."
15821,"Sirius heaved an enormous sigh and rubbed his shadowed eyes."
15794,"It had brought back memories of his son, and the old scandal, and his fall from grace at the Ministry."
15758,"Crouch's principles might've been good in the beginning - I wouldn't know."
15734,"Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries decline comment. . ."
15682,"He tipped his ginger roots into the cauldron too, and wondered whether he ought to take a leaf out of Moody s book and start drinking only from a private hip flask."
15578,"Fleur bent down, kissed Harry twice on each cheek (he felt his face burn and wouldn't have been surprised if steam was coming out of his ears again), then said to Ron, ""And you too-you 'elped -""  ""Yeah,"" said Ron, looking extremely hopeful, ""yeah, a bit -""  Fleur swooped down on him too and kissed him."
15569,"Now he was out of the water, it seemed perfectly clear that Dumbledores safety precautions wouldn't have permitted the death of a hostage just because their champion hadn't turned up."
15539,"He seized the little girl around the waist, grabbed the neck of Rons robes, and kicked off from the bottom."
15508,"He looked down at his watch to see how much time was left - it had stopped working."
15462,"Then, at long last, he heard a snatch of haunting mersong."
15435,"The water didn't feel icy anymore either ... on the contrary, he felt pleasantly cool and very light. . . ."
15430,"The first gulp of icy lake water felt like the breath of life."
15426,"Then, quite suddenly, Harry felt as though an invisible pillow had been pressed over his mouth and nose."
15421,"He was chewing the gillyweed as hard and fast as he could; it felt unpleasantly slimy and rubbery, like octopus tentacles."
15412,"It was obvious from the looks on their faces that they had thought he wasn't going to turn up."
15290,"They were supposed to be practicing the opposite of the Summoning Charm today - the Banishing Charm."
15221,"Then Moody closed his mouth and turned his blue eye upon Snape again."
15169,"Harry watched closely as the dot moved around and around the room, pausing here and there. ..."
15041,"They left; many people were staring at them as they went."
14971,"He didn't sound anxious - if anything, he sounded hopeful."
14966,"Harrys insides gave a guilty squirm, but he ignored them."
14964,"There was a Hogsmeade visit halfway through January."
14911,"It was pawing the ground nervously with its golden hooves and throwing back its horned head."
14875,"The Gryffindor common room was much quieter than it had been lately, many yawns punctuating the lazy conversations."
14874,"He liked being back on speaking terms with Ron too much to speak his mind right now - but he somehow thought that Hermione had gotten the point much better than Ron had."
14795,"Karkaroff, Harry saw, looked slightly discomposed to see them standing there."
14748,"Hermione came over and sat down in Parvati's empty chair."
14720,"Harry saw him give a small wave, and looking around, saw Madame Maxime return it, her opals glittering in the candlelight."
14694,"And then we had the tournament to arrange, and the aftermath of the Cup to deal with - that revolting Skeeter woman buzzing around - no, poor man, he's having a well earned, quiet Christmas."
14656,"Over their heads he saw that an area of lawn right in front of the castle had been transformed into a sort of grotto full of fairy lights - meaning hundreds of actual living fairies were sitting in the rosebushes that had been conjured there, and fluttering over the statues of what seemed to be Father Christmas and his reindeer."
14653,"Crabbe and Goyle were both wearing green; they resembled moss-colored boulders, and neither of them, Harry was pleased to see, had managed to find a partner."
14630,"They went out onto the grounds in the afternoon; the snow was untouched except for the deep channels made by the Durmstrang and Beauxbatons students on their way up to the castle."
14619,"The reason they were extra-knobbly was that Harry had been using them to cushion his Sneakoscope for over a year now."
14605,"Then, spotting the look on Hermione's face, he said, ""Come on, how'm I supposed to concentrate with all this noise going on?"
14525,"Harry turned to look at her and his stomach gave a weird lurch as though he had missed a step going downstairs."
14464,"The girl walked off looking rather hurt, and Harry had to endure Dean's, Seamus's, and Ron's taunts about her all through History of Magic."
14431,"Professor McGonagall's irritated voice cracked like a whip through the Transfiguration class on Thursday, and Harry and Ron both jumped and looked up."
14387,"She and Ron had followed Harry and Dobby to the end of the kitchen."
14382,"She was wearing a neat little skirt and blouse with a matching blue hat, which had holes in it for her large ears."
14315,"Ron shouted angrily as he and Harry backed into the wall of Hagrid's cabin, still holding the skrewt off with their sparks."
14204,"The tent was divided into cubicles; he could make out Cedric's shadow through the canvas, but Cedric didn't seem to be badly injured; he was sitting up, at least."
14097,"She didn't seem herself either; in fact, she looked nearly as anxious as Hermione."
14089,"It returned in full measure, however, on the following morning."
14074,"He wanted to skip Divination to keep practicing, but Hermione refused point-blank to skive off Arithmancy, and there was no point in staying without her."
14035,"In the corner on a small table stood an object that looked something like an extra-squiggly, golden television aerial."
14031,"In Professor Lockhart's day, the walls had been plastered with beaming, winking pictures of Professor Lockhart himself."
13977,"Alarmed as she was by Sirius's warnings about Karkaroff, Hermione still thought that the dragons were the more pressing problem."
13930,"The room was in semidarkness; the flames were the only source of light."
13922,"He had sneaked off his ship to try and find out what the first task was going to be."
13863,"Harry hurried to follow and found, to his great surprise, that Hagrid was leading him to the Beauxbatons carriage."
13858,"There was an air of enormous excitement about Hagrid."
13738,"Harry strode over to the barn owl, took the letter off its leg, and unrolled it."
13727,"The photographer seemed keenest to get Fleur at the front, but Rita Skeeter kept hurrying forward and dragging Harry into greater prominence."
13668,"The moment Rita Skeeter had spoken, the green quill had started to scribble, skidding across the parchment:  Attractive blonde Rita Skeeter, forty-three, who's savage quill has punctured many inflated reputations - ""Lovely,"" said Rita Skeeter, yet again, and she ripped the top piece of parchment off, crumpled it up, and stuffed it into her handbag."
13644,"Harry swung his bag over his shoulder, got up, and headed for the door."
13606,"Ron was standing against the wall with Dean and Seamus."
13588,"He thought he could have coped with the rest of the school's behavior if he could just have had Ron back as a friend, but he wasn't going to try and persuade Ron to talk to him if Ron didn't want to."
13575,"Hagrid's beetle-black eyes looked very anxious under his wild eyebrows."
13569,"To the class's horror, Hagrid proceeded to explain that the reason the skrewts had been killing one another was an excess of pent-up energy, and that the solution would be for each student to fix a leash on a skrewt and take it for a short walk."
13567,"Half the Triwizard champions have died..  . how long d'you reckon you're going to last, Potter?"
13554,"If Harry had thought that matters would improve once everyone got used to the idea of him being champion, the following day showed him how mistaken he was."
13514,"He wrenched the hangings shut around his four-poster, leaving Harry standing there by the door, staring at the dark red velvet curtains, now hiding one of the few people he had been sure would believe him."
13493,"She must have dashed through every picture lining seven staircases to reach here before him."
13481,"Couldn't someone have put Harry's name in the goblet as a trick, a practical joke?"
13412,"Harry will just have to do the best he  - ""  The door behind them opened again, and a large group of people came in: Professor Dumbledore, followed closely by Mr. Crouch, Professor Karkaroff, Madame Maxime, Professor McGonagall, and Professor Snape."
13340,"The flames inside the goblet turned suddenly red again."
13336,"He took out his wand and gave a great sweeping wave with it; at once, all the candles except those inside the carved pumpkins were extinguished, plunging them into a state of semidarkness."
13278,"A look of great excitement suddenly dawned on Hermione's face."
13198,"When the second course arrived they noticed a number of unfamiliar desserts too."
13152,"Three of them were still clutching scarves and shawls around their heads."
13120,"They were shivering, which was unsurprising, given that their robes seemed to be made of fine silk, and none of them were wearing cloaks."
13119,"Harry, whose attention had been focused completely upon Madame Maxime, now noticed that about a dozen boys and girls, all, by the look of them, in their late teens, had emerged from the carriage and were now standing behind Madame Maxime."
13108,"Then Harry saw a shining, high-heeled black shoe emerging from the inside of the carriage - a shoe the size of a child's sled - followed, almost immediately, by the largest woman he had ever seen in his life."
13096,"They scanned the darkening grounds excitedly, but nothing was moving; everything was still, silent, and quite as usual."
13074,"Harry pulled off Sirius's reply and offered Hedwig his bacon rinds, which she ate gratefully."
13039,"During the following week, there seemed to be only one topic of conversation, no matter where Harry went: the Triwizard Tournament."
13022,"Meanwhile Professor Binns, the ghost who taught History of Magic, had them writing weekly essays on the goblin rebellions of the eighteenth century."
13019,"Hermione, who had turned rather pink again, seemed to be trying not to look too pleased with herself."
12977,"Harry said, stroking her back as he carried her on his arm to one of the holes in the wall."
12976,"In the end, it was Harry suggesting she might be too tired, and that perhaps he would ask Ron to borrow Pigwidgeon, that made her stick out her leg and allow him to tie the letter to it."
12946,"Harry read it aloud:  Harry - I'm flying north immediately."
12924,"Fred and George had been gone ten minutes or so when the portrait hole opened and Hermione climbed into the common room carrying a sheaf of parchment in one hand and a box whose contents rattled as she walked in the other."
12880,"Neville was standing alone, halfway up the passage, staring at the stone wall opposite him with the same horrified, wide-eyed look he had worn when Moody had demonstrated the Cruciatus Curse."
12859,"Harry had been picturing his parents' deaths over and over again for three years now, ever since he'd found out they had been murdered, ever since he'd found out what had happened that night: Wormtail had betrayed his parents' whereabouts to Voldemort, who had come to find them at their cottage."
12855,"Harry stared at the blank blackboard as though fascinated by it, but not really seeing it at all...."
12843,"Several people looked uneasily around at her, including Ron."
12833,"No sound came from it, but Harry was sure that if it could have given voice, it would have been screaming."
12826,"Moody was looking very intently at Neville, this time with both eyes."
12707,"When the bell rang to signal the start of afternoon lessons, Harry and Ron set off for North Tower where, at the top of a tightly spiraling staircase, a silver stepladder led to a circular trapdoor in the ceiling, and the room where Professor Trelawney lived."
12703,"Hagrid simply loved monstrous creatures, the more lethal, the better."
12687,"They looked like deformed, shell-less lobsters, horribly pale and slimy-looking, with legs sticking out in very odd places and no visible heads."
12664,"A few seats along, Fred, George, and Lee Jordan were discussing magical methods of aging themselves and bluffing their way into the Triwizard Tournament."
12650,"The portrait swung forward to reveal a hole in the wall through which they all climbed."
12603,"The blue eye was moving ceaselessly, without blinking, and was rolling up, down, and from side to side, quite independently of the normal eye - and then it rolled right over, pointing into the back of the man's head, so that all they could see was whiteness."
12579,"But Hermione gave him a look so reminiscent of Professor McGonagall that he gave up."
12578,"Another clap of thunder shook the windows, and the stormy ceiling flashed, illuminating the golden plates as the remains of the first course vanished and were replaced, instantly, with puddings."
12518,"On Snape's other side was an empty seat, which Harry guessed was Professor McGonagall's."
12476,"Harry yelled, seeing a gigantic silhouette at the far end of the platform."
12450,"The lunch trolley came rattling along the corridor, and Harry bought a large stack of Cauldron Cakes for them to share."
12419,"They were very relieved to get out at King's Cross, even though the rain was coming down harder than ever, and they got soaked carrying their trunks across the busy road and into the station."
12392,"There was a funny spluttering noise from behind them."
12384,"It had a moldy-looking lace frill at the collar and matching lace cuffs."
12366,"Fred and George were sitting in a far corner, quills out, talking in whispers, their heads bent over a piece of parchment."
12348,"There was a silence in which Ron fidgeted absentmindedly with a hole in his Chudley Cannons bedspread."
12149,"Perhaps there was truth in what Malfoy had said; perhaps Hermione was in more danger than they were."
12094,"Then he realized that their heads were hooded and their faces masked."
12026,"Ministry wizards were flooding onto the field to separate the veela and the leprechauns, but with little success; meanwhile, the pitched battle below was nothing to the one taking place above."
12025,"Watching through his Omnioculars, Harry saw that they didn't look remotely beautiful now."
12022,"The leprechauns had risen into the air again, and this time, they formed a giant hand, which was making a very rude sign indeed at the veela across the field."
12009,"The veela on the other side of the field leapt to their feet, tossed their hair angrily, and started to dance again."
11987,"One hundred thousand wizards gasped as the two Seekers, Krum and Lynch, plummeted through the center of the Chasers, so fast that it looked as though they had just jumped from airplanes without parachutes."
11986,"The veela had stopped dancing, and Bulgaria was again in possession of the Quaffle."
11924,"However, under the gaze of the Minister of Magic, Mr. Malfoy didn't dare say anything."
11917,"Mr. Weasley and Mr. Malfoy looked at each other and Harry vividly recalled the last time they had come face-to-face: It had been in Flourish and Blotts' bookshop, and they had had a fight."
11911,"Edging along the second row to three still-empty seats right behind Mr. Weasley were none other than Dobby the house-elf's former owners: Lucius Malfoy; his son, Draco; and a woman Harry supposed must be Draco's mother."
11855,"By dusk, the still summer air itself seemed to be quivering with anticipation, and as darkness spread like a curtain over the thousands of waiting wizards, the last vestiges of pretence disappeared: the Ministry seemed to have bowed to the inevitable and stopped fighting the signs of blatant magic now breaking out everywhere."
11846,"Still, it's not as though we haven't got anything to took forward to, eh, Barty?"
11839,"I thought the chap was asking to borrow a pair of tweezers."
11805,"He was wearing long Quidditch robes in thick horizontal stripes of bright yellow and black."
11795,"Splintered matches littered the ground around him, but he looked as though he was having the time of his life."
11794,"Mr. Weasley was having no success at all in lighting the fire, but it wasn't for lack of trying."
11764,"They had walked into a patch of tents that were all covered with a thick growth of shamrocks, so that it looked as though small, oddly shaped hillocks had sprouted out of the earth."
11760,"Some, with furtive looks around them, conjured fires with their wands; others were striking matches with dubious looks on their faces, as though sure this couldn't work."
11750,"After a quick tour of the girls' tent, which was slightly smaller than the boys', though without the smell of cats, Harry, Ron, and Hermione set off across the campsite with the kettle and saucepans."
11731,"They trudged up the misty field between long rows of tents."
11567,"Ron and Hermione had been so deeply involved in helping Sirius escape from the Ministry of Magic that they were almost as concerned about Harry's godfather as he was."
11532,"Mrs. Weasley repeated, in a dangerous sort of voice."
11471,"Indeed, from the tone of his voice when he next spoke, Harry was quite sure that Mr. Weasley thought Dudley was quite as mad as the Dursleys thought he was, except that Mr. Weasley felt sympathy rather than fear."
11440,"Aunt Petunia shrieked and fell backward over the coffee table; Uncle Vernon caught her before she hit the floor, and gaped, speechless, at the Weasleys, all of whom had bright red hair, including Fred and George, who were identical to the last freckle."
11386,"Their children might don Muggle clothing during the holidays, but Mr. and Mrs. Weasley usually wore long robes in varying states of shabbiness."
11288,"Every bit of it was covered in stamps except for a square inch on the front, into which Mrs. Weasley had squeezed the Dursleys' address in minute writing."
11202,"It had been doubly hard to return to the Dursleys knowing that he had so nearly escaped them forever."
11193,"Harry leapt up from the bed, hurried across the room, and sat down at his desk; he pulled a piece of parchment toward him, loaded his eagle-feather quill with ink, wrote Dear Sirius, then paused, wondering how best to phrase his problem, still marveling at the fact that he hadn't thought of Sirius straight away."
11188,"The Weasleys were Harry's favorite family in the world; he was hoping that they might invite him to stay any time now (Ron had mentioned something about the Quidditch World Cup), and he somehow didn't want his visit punctuated with anxious inquiries about his scar."
11181,"But ... but You-Know-Who can't be near you now, can he?"
11166,"At once, Hermione Granger's voice seemed to fill his head, shrill and panicky."
11153,"If it hadn't been for Voldemort, Harry would not have had the lightning scar on his forehead."
11124,"Even Quidditch  -  in Harry's opinion, the best sport in the world  -  couldn't distract him at the moment."
11116,"As it happened, there was an extraordinary number of unusual things in this room."
11114,"Harry put his face into his hands, blocking out his bedroom, trying to hold on to the picture of that dimly lit room, but it was like trying to keep water in his cupped hands; the details were now trickling away as fast as he tried to hold on to them..."
11086,"And then the chair was facing Frank, and he saw what was sitting in it."
11078,"And I'll tell youthis too,"" he added, on a sudden inspiration, ""my wife knows I'm up here, and if I don't come back  - ""  ""You have no wife,"" said te cold voice, very quietly."
11004,"Frank caught a glimpse of a small man, his back to the door, pushing the chair into place."
10966,"As there was no proof that the Riddles had been murdered at all, the police were forced to let Frank go."
10943,"The maid had run screaming down the hill into the village and roused as many people as she could."
10912,"I used your name but told them to take the gold from my own Gringotts vault."
10882,"I'll fix it up with Mum and Dad, then I'll call you."
10830,"That brings her total of real predictions up to two."
10809,"Lupin threw his last few books into his case, closed the desk drawers, and turned to look at Harry."
10686,"He reached out, and as Buckbeak's wings fell, was able to tap sharply on the glass."
10663,"I knew I could do it this time,"" said Harry, ""because I'd already done it...."
10653,"It was shining brightly as the moon above ... it was coming back to him...."
10617,"He and Hermione would be running to him any moment...."
10600,"Then they saw movement  -   ""There goes Lupin,"" Hermione whispered."
10578,"Had all four of them been out on the grounds tonight?"
10435,"He looked wildly around at Hermione, the chain of the hourglass cutting into his neck."
10429,"He saw a tiny, sparkling hourglass hanging from it."
10401,"He crossed to the door and held it open for Snape, but Snape hadn't moved."
10388,"Harry jumped up out of bed; Hermione had done the same."
10313,"By the feeble light of his formless Patronus, He saw a dementor halt, very close to him."
10287,"Black was bleeding; there were gashes across his muzzle and back, but at Harry's words he scrambled up again, and in an instant, the sound of his paws faded to silence as he pounded away across the grounds."
10246,"Pettigrew was still wheezing and occasionally whimpering."
10238,"Black's gaunt face broke into the first true smile Harry had seen upon it."
10237,"Black turned right around to look at him; Snape's head was scraping the ceiling but Black didn't seem to care."
10213,"Lupin helped him to his feet; Ron put his weight gingerly on the leg and didn't wince."
10168,"It's so much harder for them to sense animal emotions that they were confused...."
10109,"There was another blinding flash of light and then  -   It was like watching a speeded-up film of a growing tree."
10035,"Not even I dreamed you would have the nerve to use this old place as your hideout  - ""  ""Severus, you're making a mistake,"" said Lupin urgently."
9946,"Black stopped struggling, though his hollowed eyes were still fixed on Scabbers, who was clamped tightly under Ron's bitten, scratched, ad bleeding hands."
9932,"Twenty minutes later, you left Hagrid, and set off back toward the castle."
9901,"But he never finished the question, because what he saw made his voice die in his throat."
9889,"Black was going to be handed back to the dementors."
9855,"His thin chest rose and fell rapidly as he watched Harry walking slowly nearer, his wand pointing straight at Black's heart."
9838,"The taunt about his father rang in Harry's ears as though Black had bellowed it."
9780,"He slithered between the battering branches like a snake and placed his front paws upon a knot on the trunk."
9754,"By the time they reached open ground, darkness was settling like a spell around them."
9685,"Harry had the cloak hidden down tie front of his robes; he had to keep his arms folded to hide the lump."
9612,"Harry gathered that they were representatives of the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures, because tie very old wizard squinted toward Hagrid's cabin and said in a feeble voice, ""Dear, dear, I'm getting too old for this...."
9581,"Exams were nearly upon them, and instead of lazing around outside, the students were forced to remain inside the castle, trying to bully their brains into concentrating while enticing wafts of summer air drifted in through the windows."
9573,"There was Percy, jumping up and down like a maniac, all dignity forgotten."
9550,"Lee Jordan was howling into the megaphone, dancing out of Professor McGonagall's reach."
9547,"Malfoy had thrown himself forward, grabbed hold of the Firebolt's tail, and was pulling it back."
9533,"Madam Hooch awarded both teams penalties, and Wood pulled off another spectacular save, making the score forty-ten to Gryffindor."
9508,"Angelina was nearly thrown from her broom as Marcus Flint went smashing into her."
9487,"Harry climbed onto the windowsill to look right down into the shadows of the castle, but they weren't there."
9449,"The whole of Gryffindor House took up the challenge enthusiastically, so that it was impossible for Harry to get to classes on time because he was surrounded by a vast, chattering crowd."
9426,"Ron had taken over responsibility for Buckbeak's appeal."
9379,"Together they climbed the ladder into the dim, stifling tower room."
9378,"Hermione joined them at the foot of the ladder to Professor Trelawneys classroom twenty minutes later, looking extremely harrassed."
9372,"Hermione was sitting at a table, fast asleep, her head resting on an open Arithmancy book."
9346,"Their only chance of talking to him was during Care of Magical Creatures lessons."
9296,"Seconds later, Professor Lupin was clambering out of the fireplace, brushing ash off his shabby robes."
9086,"His portrait had been taken back to its lonely landing on the seventh floor, and the Fat Lady was back."
9083,"Professor McGonagall came back at dawn, to tell them that he had again escaped."
9017,"All right, then... if she wanted to tail him, she'd have to take the consequences...."
8924,"Close-up, Harry saw that she looked almost as tired as Lupin."
8880,"January faded imperceptibly into February, with no change in the bitterly cold weather."
8815,"Lupin grasped the lid of the packing case and pulled."
8763,"Professor Trelawney hesitated, then lowered herself into the empty chair, eyes shut and mouth clenched tight, as though expecting a thunderbolt to hit the table."
8699,"Hagrid went quiet for a moment, staring into his tea."
8605,"There was his father waving up at him, beaming, the untidy black hair Harry had inherited standing up in all directions."
8599,"Ron and Herinione watched Harry nervously all through dintier, not daring to talk about what they'd overheard, because Percy was sitting close by them."
8545,"But, as we all know, You-Know-Who met his downfall in little Harry Potter."
8509,"The door of the Three Broomsticks had opened again."
8444,"Harry glanced quickly up and down the corridor, then tucked the map away again, hoisted himself into the hole headfirst, and pushed himself forward."
8181,"I  - ""  But it wasn't Professor Lupin who looked up at him from the teacher's desk; it was Snape."
8111,"Instead he adopted an oily voice that was no better than his cackle."
8109,"It was Peeves the Poltergeist, bobbing over the crowd and looking delighted, as he always did, at the sight of wreckage or worry."
8039,"He accompanied them to the entrance hall, where Filch, the caretaker, was standing inside the front doors, checking off names against a long list, peering suspiciously into every face, and making sure that no one was sneaking out who shouldn't be going."
8038,"He and Hermione had finally forgotten their squabble about Crookshanks in the face of Harry's difficulties."
8007,"He barely talked to her all through Herbology, even though he, Harry, and Hermione were working together on the same puffapod."
8001,"Ron tried to pull the bag away from Crookshanks, but Crookshanks clung on, spitting and slashing."
7906,"Neville looked startled, but said, ""Well... always the same hat."
7890,"Nobody knows what a boggart looks like when he is alone, but when I let him out, he will immediately become whatever each of us most fears."
7884,"As Professor Lupin went to stand next to it, the wardrobe gave a sudden wobble, banging off the wall."
7870,"They set off again, the class looking at shabby Professor Lupin with increased respect."
7862,"Puzzled but interested, the class got to its feet and followed Professor Lupin out of the classroom."
7851,"Harry wasn't surprised; he could see that it was crammed with at least a dozen large and heavy books."
7790,"He swaggered into the dungeon, his right arm covered in bandages and bound up in a sling, acting, in Harry's opinion, as though he were the heroic survivor of some dreadful battle."
7774,"I don't know,"" Hermione said slowly, and Harry saw her glance at him."
7772,"They went up to the crowded Gryffindor common room after dinner and tried to do the homework Professor McGonagall had given them, but all three of them kept breaking off and glancing Out of the tower window."
7768,"They were among the first to reach the Great Hall at dinnertime, hoping to see Hagrid, but he wasn't there."
7765,"They all climbed the stone steps into the deserted entrance hall."
7666,"Harry, Ron, and Hermione descended Professor Trelawney's ladder and the winding stair in silence, then set off for Professor McGonagall's Transfiguration lesson."
7662,"Seamus Finnigan was tilting his head from side to side."
7600,"In fact, it didn't look like a classroom at all, more like a cross between someone's attic and an old-fashioned tea shop."
7593,"Every now and then they spotted him running through a picture ahead."
7561,"Harry, Ron, and Hermione were the last to stop clapping, and as Professor Dumbledore started speaking again, they saw that Hagrid was wiping his eyes on the tablecloth."
7531,"Harry went back into the corridor with Madam Pomfrey, who left for the hospital wing, muttering to herself He had to wait only a few minutes; then Hermione emerged looking very happy about something, followed by Professor McGonagall, and the three of them made their way back down the marble staircase to the Great Hall."
7529,"The thought of what Draco Malfoy would say if he had to go to the hospital wing was torture."
7516,"With a tiny hint of sarcasm in his voice, he said, ""Oh, no  -  er  -  Professor,"" then he smirked at Crabbe and Goyle and led them up the steps into the castle."
7451,"Professor Lupin appeared to be holding a handful of flames."
7393,"This had only one occupant, a man sitting fast asleep next to the window."
7392,"Harry, Ron, and Hermione set off down the corridor, looking for an empty compartment, but all were full except for the one at the very end of the train."
7385,"With a meaningful look at Harry, he leaned casually against the barrier."
7355,"Sirius Black had murdered thirteen people with one curse; Mr. and Mrs, Weasley obviously thought Harry would be panic-stricken if he knew the truth."
7332,"They didn't report it in the press because Fudge wanted it kept quiet, but Fudge went out to Azkaban the night Black escaped."
7263,"He got up, dressed, went for a last look at the Firebolt, and was just wondering where he'd have lunch, when someone yelled his name and he turned."
7243,"I thought we'd seen the worst when we bought two hundred copies of the Invisible Book of Invisibility -cost a fortune, and we never found them...."
7237,"Now Harry understood why Hagrid had said it would come in useful."
7212,"He could even go wherever he pleased, as long as it was in Diagon Alley, and as this long cobbled street was packed with the most fascinating wizarding shops in the world, Harry felt no desire to break his word to Fudge and stray back into the Muggle world."
7208,"The sky outside the window was changing rapidly from deep, velvety blue to cold, steely gray and then, slowly, to pink shot with gold."
7201,"And with a last smile and shake of Harry's hand, Fudge left the room."
7178,"He was still waiting to hear what was going to happen to him now."
7171,"Two members of the Accidental Magic Reversal Department were dispatched to Privet Drive a few hours ago."
7133,"Was inflating Aunt Marge bad enough to land him in Azkaban?"
7132,"He, Harry, had broken wizard law just like Sirius Black."
7074,"One of the knees in his jeans was torn, and the hand he had thrown out to break his fall was bleeding."
7056,"A funny prickling on the back of his neck had made Harry feel he was being watched, but the street appeared to be deserted, and no lights shone from any of the large square houses."
7036,"But after ten minutes alone in the dark street, a new emotion overtook him: panic."
6884,"Extremely unusual though he was, at that moment Harry Potter felt just like everyone else  -  glad, for the first time in his life, that it was his birthday."
6810,"He had pinned his Head Boy badge to the fez perched jauntily on top of his neat hair, his horn-rimmed glasses flashing in the Egyptian sun."
6756,"Of all the unusual things about Harry, this scar was the most extraordinary of all."
6708,"Harry's dead parents, who had been a witch and wizard themselves, were never mentioned under the Dursleys' roof For years, Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon had hoped that if they kept Harry as downtrodden as possible, they would be able to squash the magic out of him."
6674,"Draco was no longer strutting around the school as though he owned the place."
6654,"Mr. Malfoy ripped the sock off the diary, threw it aside, then looked furiously from the ruined book to Harry."
6633,"Imagine the effect on Arthur Weasley and his Muggle Protection Act, if his own daughter was discovered attacking and - killing Muggle-borns ...."
6621,"They'd heard that Arthur Weasleys daughter had been killed and wanted me back here at once."
6583,"When Dumbledore addressed him, Lockhart looked over his shoulder to see who he was talking to."
6547,"Mrs. Weasley let go of Harry, who hesitated for a moment, then walked over to the desk and laid upon it the Sorting Hat, the rubyencrusted sword, and what remained of Riddle's diary."
6490,"Then, without thinking, without considering, as though he had meant to do it all along, Harry seized the basilisk fang on the floor next to him and plunged it straight into the heart of the book."
6467,"A patch of scarlet swam past, and Harry heard a soft clatter of claws beside him."
6453,"A gleaming silver sword had appeared inside the hat, its handle glittering with rubies the size of eggs."
6452,"Stars winking in front of his eyes, he grabbed the top of the hat to pull it off and felt something long and hard beneath it."
6400,"If it had to be a fight between him and Riddle, better sooner than later."
6387,"Harry breathed, and he felt the bird's golden claws squeeze his shoulder gently  ""And that -"" said Riddle, now eyeing the ragged thing that Fawkes had dropped, ""that's the old school Sorting Hat -""  So it was."
6372,"Dumbledore saw through you when you were at school and he still frightens you now, wherever you're hiding these days -""  The smile had gone from Riddle's face, to be replaced by a very ugly look."
6350,"What if, even worse, I told you who'd been strangling roosters?"
6345,"Dumbledore never seemed to like me as much as the other teachers did ......"
6337,"Anger was coursing through him, and it was an effort to keep his voice steady."
6319,"So Ginny poured out her soul to me, and her soul happened to be exactly what I wanted ...."
6290,"He pointed toward the floor near the statue's giant toes."
6174,"Id never sell another book -""  Harry reached his wand just in time."
6169,"It's not all book signings and publicity photos, you know."
6115,"He didn't seem to notice that the other teachers were looking at him with something remarkably like hatred."
6113,"For one wild moment, Harry was sure it would be Dumbledore."
6076,"That why I've been hearing that voice all over the place, and nobody else has heard it."
6069,"This snake, which may reach gigantic size and live many hundreds of years, is born  from a chicken's egg, hatched beneath a toad."
6029,"She looked tense and nervous, and Harry noticed that her hands were twisting in her lap."
5965,"Feet away, towering above him, was a solid wall of spiders, clicking, their many eyes gleaming in their ugly black heads."
5886,"He had never been this deep into the forest before."
5824,"Most of their fellow students seemed glad that they were being shepherded from class to class by teachers, but Harry found it very irksome."
5805,"Mr. Lucius Malfoy strode into Hagrid's hut, swathed in a long black traveling cloak, smiling a cold and satisfied smile."
5777,"They found themselves face-to-face with him aiming a crossbow at them."
5776,"Seconds after they had knocked, Hagrid flung it open."
5753,"The Gryffindors packed inside the common room listened to Professor McGonagall in silence."
5733,"Oliver Wood, looking devastated, landed and ran toward Professor McGonagall without getting off his broomstick."
5696,"But the only thing Harry felt he was really good at was Quidditch."
5637,"Harry could tell that Riddle was doing some serious thinking."
5619,"This was Hogwarts as Riddle had known it, meaning that this unknown wizard was Headmaster, not Dumbledore, and he, Harry, was little more than a phantom, completely invisible to the people of fifty years ago."
5575,"The words shone momentarily on the page and they, too, sank without trace."
5521,"He was still convinced that Harry was the guilty one, that he had ""given himself away"" at the Dueling Club."
5477,"You just had to wander around with your nose in it, trying to do everything one-handed."
5474,"It had a shabby black cover and was as wet as everything else in the bathroom."
5402,"The Slytherin common room was a long, low underground room with rough stone walls and ceiling from which round, greenish lamps were hanging on chains."
5395,"Harry almost said something apologetic to Percy but caught himself just in time."
5380,"The words had barely left his mouth when a girl with long, curly hair emerged from the entrance."
5379,"All they needed now was a Slytherin that they could follow to the Slytherin common room, but there was nobody around."
5351,"The potion hissed loudly like a boiling kettle and frothed madly."
5334,"By far the hardest part was hiding them in the closet across the hall."
5236,"As he and Professor McGonagall stepped onto it, Harry heard the wall thud closed behind them."
5184,"He dropped his voice until it was barely more than a whisper, and said, ""That's probably why You- Know-Who wanted to kill him in the first place."
5144,"Both he and Hermione were looking as though someone had died."
5133,"Snape stepped forward, waved his wand, and the snake vanished in a small puff of black smoke."
5126,"Enraged, hissing furiously, it slithered straight toward Justin Finch-Fletchley and raised itself again, fangs exposed, poised to strike."
5049,"The holidays would be the perfect time to use the Polyjuice Potion and try to worm a confession out of him."
5022,"Harry dressed as quickly as he could and hurried off to Gryffindor Tower, desperate to tell Ron and Hermione about Colin and Dobby, but they weren't there."
4957,"It took a while to stuff the rubbery, boneless arm into a sleeve."
4921,"He could hear laughter from the crowd; he knew he must look very stupid, but the rogue Bludger was heavy and couldn't change direction as quickly as Harry could; he began a kind of roller-coaster ride around the edges of the stadium, squinting through the silver sheets of rain to the Gryffindor goal posts, where Adrian Pucey was trying to get past Wood  A whistling in Harry's ear told him the Bludger had just missed him again; he turned right over and sped in the opposite direction."
4897,"Harry saw George give the Bludger a powerful whack in the direction of Adrian Pucey, but the Bludger changed direction in midair and shot straight for Harry again."
4881,"He was nervous, mainly at the thought of what Wood would say if Gryffindor lost, but also at the idea of facing a team mounted on the fastest racing brooms gold could buy."
4830,"When he reached absently for his wand to remove the smudges, it ignited the parchment."
4827,"And he strode off, the back of his neck as red as Ron's ears."
4809,"Ron was standing well back and seemed to be fighting the impulse to run."
4748,"Harry had been held back in Potions, where Snape had made him stay behind to scrape tubeworms off the desks."
4715,"Harry said loudly, uncomfortably aware of everyone looking at him, including all the Lockharts on the walls."
4694,"Lockhart, looking excited and important, hurried after Dumbledore; so did Professors McGonagall and Snape."
4673,"As they edged nearer, Harry almost slipped - there was a large puddle of water on the floor; Ron and Hermione grabbed him, and they inched toward the message, eyes fixed on a dark shadow beneath it."
4647,"The assembly clapped wildly; Harry started to clap, too, but stopped quickly at the sight of Nick's face."
4608,"The firelight glowed over the countless squashy armchairs where people sat reading, talking, doing homework or, in the case of Fred and George Weasley, trying to find out what would happen if you fed a Filibuster firework to a salamander."
4552,"Nearly Headless Nick took several deep breaths and then said, in a far calmer tone, ""So - what's bothering you?"
4545,"He was pale as smoke, and Harry could see right through him to the dark sky and torrential rain outside."
4538,"Raindrops the size of bullets thundered on the castle windows for days on end; the lake rose, the flower beds turned into muddy streams, and Hagrid's pumpkins swelled to the size of garden sheds."
4522,"He was straining his ears to hear the voice again, but there was no sound now except for Lockhart telling him he mustn't expect a treat like this every time he got detention."
4497,"Professor McGonagall was walking toward them, looking stern."
4474,"I could tell it was really rude, of course -""  ""It's about the most insulting thing he could think of,"" gasped Ron, coming back up."
4438,"Harry knew at once that Malfoy had said something really bad because there was an instant uproar at his words."
4414,"He soared right around the stadium at full speed, racing Fred and George."
4398,"As Wood launched into a speech about his new tactics, Fred Weasley's head drooped right onto Alicia Spinnet's shoulder and he began to snore."
4370,"Harry, however, was shaken awake several hours earlier  *104*  than he would have liked by Oliver Wood, Captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch team."
4367,"Hedwig was still angry with Harry about the disasterous car journey and Ron's wand was still malfunctioning, surpassing itself on Friday morning by shooting out of Ron's hand in Charms and hitting tiny old Professor Flitwick squarely between the eyes, creating a large, throbbing green boil where it had struck."
4364,"The bell rang and there was a mad rush toward the exit."
4360,"The rest proceeded to wreck the classroom more effectively than a rampaging rhino."
4329,"He waited for them to laugh; a few people smiled weakly."
4231,"Professor Sprout was a squat little witch who wore a patched hat over her flyaway hair; there was usually a large amount of earth on her clothes and her fingernails would have made Aunt Petunia faint."
4069,"When they flew back beneath the clouds a little while later, they had to squint through the darkness for a landmark they knew."
4013,"Five minutes after that, they skidded to a halt in the yard so that Fred could run in for his broomstick."
4008,"Harry couldn't see how eight people, six large trunks, two owls, and a rat were going to fit into one small Ford Anglia."
3989,"Mr. Weasley flushed darker than either Ron or Ginny."
3959,"The crowd seemed to be made up mostly of witches around Mrs. Weasley's age."
3889,"Malfoy bent down to examine a shelf full of skulls."
3888,"Special permission from Dumbledore so he could play for Gryffindor."
3876,"Dizzy and bruised, covered in soot, he got gingerly to his feet, holding his broken glasses up to his eyes."
3864,"Stored in an underground vault at Gringotts in London was a small fortune that his parents had left him."
3860,"Harry had never met either of them, but knew that Charlie was in Romania studying dragons and Bill in Egypt working for the wizard's bank, Gringotts."
3843,"She nodded, blushing to the roots of her flaming hair, and put her elbow in the butter dish."
3749,"It looked as though it had once been a large stone pigpen, but extra rooms had been added here and there until it was several stories high and so crooked it looked as though it were held up by magic (which, Harry reminded himself, it probably was)."
3735,"It wouldn't be the first time he'd collapsed on a delivery."
3685,"Then the Dursleys appeared and Dudley rattled the bars of the cage, laughing at him."
3674,"The soup was stone-cold, but he drank half of it in one gulp."
3672,"The cat-flap rattled and Aunt Petunias hand appeared, pushing a bowl of canned soup into the room."
3665,"Otherwise, he was locked in his room around the clock."
3608,"A plot to make most terrible things happen at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry this year,"" whispered Dobby, suddenly trembling all over."
3544,"Voldemort might be a ruin of his former self, but he was still terrifying, still cunning, still determined to regain power."
3523,"He didn't think the Dursleys would like him any better in Majorca than they did on Privet Drive."
3511,"Some rich builder and his wife were coming to dinner and Uncle Vernon was hoping to get a huge order from him (Uncle Vernon's company made drills)."
3481,"Harry stared from his purple-faced uncle to his pale aunt, who was trying to heave Dudley to his feet."
3443,"Those who could add up while yelling themselves hoarse knew that Gryffindor now had four hundred and seventy-two points  -  exactly the same as Slytherin."
3430,"A storm of cheering and stamping broke out from the Slytherin table."
3394,"He smiled and popped the golden-brown bean into his mouth."
3379,"He didn't realize that love as powerful as your mother's for you leaves its own mark."
3363,"Dumbledore hummed a little and smiled at the ceiling."
3319,"Where there should have been a back to Quirrell's head, there was a face, the most terrible face Harry had ever seen."
3289,"And to Harry's horror, a voice answered, and the voice seemed to come from Quirrell himself  ""Use the boy..."
3284,"But how can I look without Quirrell realizing what I'm up to?"
3234,"She took a long drink from the round bottle at the end, and shuddered."
3211,"With one last desperate look back at Ron, Harry and Hermione charged through the door and up the next passageway."
3188,"Finally he said, ""Now, don't be offended or anything, but neither of you are that good at chess  - ""  ""We're not offended,"" said Harry quickly."
3175,"The next chamber was so dark they couldn't see anything at all."
3093,"He caught himself in time and hovered about a foot off the stairs."
3084,"In their nervous state, every statue's shadow looked like Filch, every distant breath of wind sounded like Peeves swooping down on them."
3057,"This was the first night he hadn't been upset by it."
2967,"In a matter of seconds, though, he was wide-eyed as Harry began to tell him and Hermione what had happened in the forest."
2966,"He shouted something about Quidditch fouls when Harry roughly shook him awake."
2897,"They had just passed a bend in the path when Hermione grabbed Hagrid's arm."
2845,"A light breeze lifted their hair as they looked into the forest."
2788,"Hermione had stopped drawing attention to herself in class, keeping her head down and working in silence."
2724,"The steep spiral staircase up to the top of the tower seemed the easiest thing in the world after that."
2711,"It was a very dark, cloudy night, and they were a bit late arriving at Hagrid's hut because they'd had to wait for Peeves to get out of their way in the entrance hall, where he'd been playing tennis against the wall."
2629,"Hermione had now started making study schedules for Harry and Ron, too."
2609,"Hagrid's beard twitched and they could tell he was smiling."
2578,"Snape was sweeping about in his usual bad temper, which surely meant that the Stone was still safe."
2470,"He must have had to bunny hop all the way up to Gryffindor tower."
2467,"Speaking quietly so that no one else would hear, Harry told the other two about Snape's sudden, sinister desire to be a Quidditch referee."
2412,"Ron tore his eyes away from this splendid sight to look excitedly at Harry."
2400,"What Harry feared most was that he might not be able to find the mirror room again."
2301,"He let the material flow over his hands, smoother than silk, light as air."
2278,"Percy Weasley stuck his head through the door, looking disapproving."
2276,"Fred and George were wearing blue sweaters, one with a large yellow F on it, the other a G."
2253,"Something fluid and silvery gray went slithering to the floor where it lay in gleaming folds."
2236,"When he woke early in the morning, however, the first thing he saw was a small pile of packages at the foot of his bed."
2212,"He had been wondering for a while if Flamel wasn't somewhere in there."
2207,"The trouble was, it was very hard to know where to begin, not knowing what Flamel might have done to get himself into a book."
2193,"Ron and his brothers were staying, too, because Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were going to Romania to visit Charlie."
2165,"Harry was speeding toward the ground when the crowd saw him clap his hand to his mouth as though he was about to be sick  -  he hit the field on all fours  -  coughed  -  and something gold fell into his hand."
2162,"Up in the air, Harry was suddenly able to clamber back on to his broom."
1971,"It roared again and started toward Ron, who was nearest and had no way to escape."
1939,"Peering around it, however, they saw not Percy but Snape."
1909,"Professor Flitwick put the class into pairs to practice."
1884,"Harry swung at it with the bat to stop it from breaking his nose, and sent it zigzagging away into the air  -  it zoomed around their heads and then shot at Wood, who dived on top of it and managed to pin it to the ground."
1840,"Hermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and Ron, but she was such a bossy know-it-all that they saw this as an added bonus."
1835,"Indeed, by the next morning Harry and Ron thought that meeting the three-headed dog had been an excellent adventure, and they were quite keen to have another one."
1751,"All the same, it wasn't what you'd call the perfect end to the day, Harry thought, as he lay awake much later listening to Dean and Seamus falling asleep (Neville wasn't back from the hospital wing)."
1746,"The most you and Malfoy'll be able to do is send sparks at each other."
1733,"Harry had just finished telling Ron what had happened when he'd left the grounds with Professor McGonagall."
1710,"Up the front steps, up the marble staircase inside, and still Professor McGonagall didn't say a word to him."
1702,"Harry caught sight of Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle's triumphant faces as he left, walking numbly in Professor McGonagall's wake as she strode toward the castle."
1677,"Neville, his face tear-streaked, clutching his wrist, hobbled off with Madam Hooch, who had her arm around him."
1673,"Harry saw his scared white face look down at the ground falling away, saw him gasp, slip sideways off the broom and  -   WHAM  -  a thud and a nasty crack and Neville lay facedown on the grass in a heap."
1578,"Harry forced himself to keep looking straight into those cold eyes."
1558,"By the end of the first Potions lesson, he knew he'd been wrong."
1544,"Harry asked Ron as he poured sugar on his porridge."
1487,"They heard him zooming away, rattling coats of armor as he passed."
1482,"He raised his voice, ""Peeves  -  show yourself""  A loud, rude sound, like the air being let out of a balloon, answered."
1477,"The Gryffindor first years followed Percy through the chattering crowds, out of the Great Hall, and up the marble staircase."
1470,"Harry noticed that the other teachers' smiles had become rather fixed."
1436,"Someone had obviously tried to behead him, but not done it properly."
1385,"As Harry stepped forward, whispers suddenly broke out like little hissing fires all over the hall."
1363,"Yes, trying on the hat was a lot better than having to do a spell, but he did wish they could have tried it on without everyone watching."
1288,"And the fleet of little boats moved off all at once, gliding across the lake, which was as smooth as glass."
1225,"Anyway, we'd better go and look for Neville's toad."
1214,"She had a bossy sort of voice, lots of bushy brown hair, and rather large front teeth."
1134,"Harry watched the girl and her mother disappear as the train rounded the corner."
1088,"He was tall, thin, and gangling, with freckles, big hands and feet, and a long nose."
1081,"They stopped and so did he, just near enough to hear what they were saying."
1053,"He got up and pulled on his jeans because he didn't want to walk into the station in his wizard's robes  -  he'd change on the train."
1007,"The late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as Harry and Hagrid made their way back down Diagon Alley, back through the wall, back through the Leaky Cauldron, now empty."
977,"No two Ollivander wands are the same, just as no two unicorns, dragons, or phoenixes are quite the same."
959,"Ten and a quarter inches long, swishy, made of willow."
958,"It seems only yesterday she was in here herself, buying her first wand."
942,"Harry now carried a large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl, fast asleep with her head under her wing."
939,"Not a toad, toads went outta fashion years ago, yeh'd be laughed at - an' I don' like cats, they make me sneeze."
891,"How often had they complained how much Harry cost them to keep?"
885,"A lot of green smoke came billowing out, and as it cleared, Harry gasped."
874,"They were in a narrow stone passageway lit with flaming torches."
787,"Hagrid took up two seats and sat knitting what looked like a canary-yellow circus tent."
749,"Harry counted out five little bronze coins, and the owl held out his leg so Harry could put the money into a small leather pouch tied to it."
742,"The hut was full of sunlight, the storm was over, Hagrid himself was asleep on the collapsed sofa, and there was an owl rapping its claw on the window, a newspaper held in its beak."
699,"Some say he's still out there, bidin' his time, like, but I don' believe it."
617,"He had been to school, after all, and his marks weren't bad."
601,"His eyes fell on the empty grate with the shriveled chip bags in it and he snorted."
560,"Dudley's snores were drowned by the low rolls of thunder that started near midnight."
545,"After what seemed like hours they reached the rock, where Uncle Vernon, slipping and sliding, led the way to the broken-down house."
516,"They ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on toast for breakfast the next day."
496,"Uncle Vernon seized Harry around the waist and threw him into the hall."
495,"The Dursleys ducked, but Harry leapt into the air trying to catch one."
442,"That evening when he got back from work, Uncle Vernon did something he'd never done before; he visited Harry in his cupboard."
430,"Aunt Petunia took it curiously and read the first line."
426,"His face went from red to green faster than a set of traffic lights."
373,"The weirdest thing about all these people was the way they seemed to vanish the second Harry tried to get a closer look."
343,"Caught by surprise, Harry fell hard on the concrete floor."
341,"As the snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind Harry made both of them jump."
321,"Uncle Vernon rapped the glass smartly with his knuckles, but the snake just snoozed on."
290,"Dudley's gang had been chasing him as usual when, as much to Harry's surprise as anyone else's, there he was sitting on the chimney."
265,"Dudley's mouth fell open in horror, but Harry's heart gave a leap."
234,"Dudley's favorite punching bag was Harry, but he couldn't often catch him."
151,"Professor McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two lemon drops, seemed not to notice."
49,"It was on his way back past them, clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he caught a few words of what they were saying."
36,"The traffic moved on and a few minutes later, Mr. Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills."
35,"But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt  -  these people were obviously collecting for something... yes, that would be it."
2,"They were the last people you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just didn't hold with such nonsense."
